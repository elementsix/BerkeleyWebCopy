  <h1>Midterm 1 Exam</h1>
</header>

<p>The exam will be from <strong>8-10:10 PM Thursday, February 8.</strong></p>

<p>Please arrive by <strong>8:00 PM</strong>. We will start promptly at 8:10 PM.</p>

<p>The midterm exam will be held at many locations across campus. We will email
your room and seating assignment for the exam to your CalCentral email address
Wednesday night before the exam. If you arrive late or go to the wrong room,
you will not be given additional time.</p>

<p>If you do not receive your seating assignment by Thursday morning, please make
a private post on Piazza to let us know.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>You do not need to bring anything except for a writing utensil and UC Berkeley
student ID. The exam is closed book, closed notes, closed computer, and closed
calculator. You may not use any electronic devices.</p>

<p>You are, however, allowed to bring <em>one</em> sheet of notes (front and back) that
you create yourself. This sheet must be handwritten and you <em>may not</em> share
it with anyone else. The purpose of these restrictions is to provide an
additional opportunity for you to practice since many students have remarked
that the process of compiling a note sheet helped them greatly when studying for
the exam.</p>

<p>The <a href="../assets/pdfs/61a-mt1-study-guide.pdf">Midterm 1 Study Guide</a> will also be provided along with the exam.
Familiarize yourself with the study guide so you know where to find information
and how to apply each rule during the exam.</p>

<p>Scratch paper will be provided but we will not grade your scratch work. You
will write your answers on the exam itself.</p>

<h2>Topics Covered</h2>

<p>The exam will cover all course topics through Chapter 1.7 of <a href="http://composingprograms.com/">Composing Programs</a>, except for Newton's method (1.6.5) and decorators (1.6.9).</p>

<p>Particular emphasis will be given to user-defined functions, assignment, iteration, higher-order functions, and environment diagrams. (The most challenging recursion questions in the course don't appear until Midterm 2.)</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>The best way to study for the midterm is to work through practice problems.
The course staff has put together the following resources.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../resources.html">Resources page</a> for past exams, <a href="../resources.html#midterm1">midterm 1 resources</a>, <a href="../resources.html#advice">advice</a> and tailored resources.</li>
  <li><a href="../articles/studying.html">Studying Guide</a> for learning strategies and problem-solving tips</li>
  <li><a href="http://tutor.cs61a.org/">Python Tutor</a> for drawing environment diagrams</li>
  <li><p><a href="../office-hours.html">Office hours</a> are a great way to get drop-in help from the course staff</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://upe.cs.berkeley.edu/oh/">UPE</a>, <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/tutor/">HKN</a>, and <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/academic-support/tutoring-schedule#ac888">CoE</a> all offer free drop-in tutoring</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="past-exams">Past Exams</h3>


<p>See <a href="../resources.html">resources page</a> for past exams, solutions, and video walkthroughs.</p>

<h3 id="lab-and-discussion">Lab and Discussion</h3>


<p>Lab 3 will be held as usual and covers recursion. There will be no lab
check-off next week so you do not need to attend in person, but we highly
recommend completing the lab before the midterm as it contains exam review
material.</p>

<p>There will be no discussion next week. Some TAs may host optional review
sessions during their regular section times. They will send an email to you if
they plan on organizing a review activity during their regular discussion
section time.</p>


<h3 id="hkn-midterm-1-review-session">HKN Midterm 1 Review Session</h3>


<p><strong>7-10 PM Saturday, February 3 in HP Auditorium</strong></p>

<p>The format will be slides reviewing the concepts, followed by example
questions. See <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jc559y99w0i4jj?cid=409">https://piazza.com/class/jc559y99w0i4jj?cid=409</a></p>

  <li>Environment Diagrams</li>
  <li>Higher-Order Functions</li>
  <li>Recursion</li>
  <li>Tree Recursion</li>
</ul>


  <h2>Seating Request</h2>

  <p>If you have a seating request, fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeX6LGIala7yovoXqGZ0r1DX6Lol8oiFDIRMu__UEr-KXJcGA/viewform">this form</a> by Sunday @ 11:59 PM.</p>



  <h2>Alternates</h2>

  <p>If you have DSP accommodations, you should have already received an email. We will send a confirmation email on Wednesday with room assignments.</p>

<p>If you have any other conflicts, please email <a href="cs61a%40berkeley.edu">cs61a@berkeley.edu</a>. As stated in the <a href="../articles/about.html#exams">policies</a> we will not be giving alternate exams for any other reason, but if you have a valid excuse, we will excuse you from the exam and use only your Midterm 2 and Final Exam scores to give you a final course grade.</p>
