  <h1>Final Exam</h1>
</header>

<p>The exam will be from <strong>11:30 AM - 2:40 PM Tuesday, May 8th.</strong></p>

<p>Please arrive by <strong>11:30 AM</strong>. We will start promptly at 11:40 AM.</p>

<p>The final exam will be held at many locations across campus. We will email
your room and seating assignment for the exam to your CalCentral email address
Monday afternoon before the exam. If you arrive late or go to the wrong room,
you will not be given additional time.</p>

<p>If you do not receive your seating assignment by Monday evening, please make
a private post on Piazza to let us know.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>You do not need to bring anything except for a writing utensil and UC Berkeley
student ID. The exam is closed book, closed notes, closed computer, and closed
calculator. You may not use any electronic devices.</p>

<p>You are, however, allowed to bring <em>three</em> sheets of notes (front and back) that
you create yourself. These sheets must be handwritten and you <em>may not</em> share
them with anyone else. The purpose of these restrictions is to provide an
additional opportunity for you to practice since many students have remarked
that the process of compiling a note sheet helped them greatly when studying for
the exam.</p>

<p>Both the <a href="../assets/pdfs/61a-mt1-study-guide.pdf">Midterm 1 Study Guide</a>, the <a href="../assets/pdfs/61a-mt2-study-guide.pdf">Midterm 2 Study Guide</a>, and the <a href="../assets/pdfs/61a-final-study-guide.pdf">Final Study Guide</a> will also
be provided along with the exam. Familiarize yourself with the study guide so
you know where to find information and how to apply each rule during the exam.</p>

<p>Scratch paper will be provided but we will not grade your scratch work. You
will write your answers on the exam itself.</p>

<h2>Topics Covered</h2>

<p>The exam will cover all course topics of <a href="http://composingprograms.com/">Composing Programs</a>, <em>except</em> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Newton's method (1.6.5),</li>
  <li>The linked list data abstraction (2.3.7)</li>
  <li>Implementing lists &amp; dictionaries (2.4.7)</li>
  <li>Dispatch dictionaries (2.4.8)</li>
  <li>Propagating constraints (2.4.9)</li>
  <li>Implementing classes and objects (2.6)</li>
  <li>Recursive select statements (4.3.5)</li>
  <li>Logic programming (4.4)</li>
  <li>Unification (4.5)</li>
  <li>Distributed computing (4.6)</li>
  <li>Distributed data processing (4.7)</li>
  <li>Parallel computing (4.8)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be prepared to answer questions that relate closely to the projects
and homework assignments (not including challenge problems). You should also
know how to draw an environment diagram by hand but will not be tested on
object-oriented or stream diagrams.</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>The best way to study for the midterm is to work through practice problems.
The course staff has put together the following resources.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../resources.html">Resources page</a> for past exams, <a href="../resources.html#final-exam">final resources</a>, <a href="../resources.html#advice">advice</a> and tailored resources.</li>
  <li><a href="../articles/studying.html">Studying Guide</a> for learning strategies and problem-solving tips</li>
  <li><a href="http://tutor.cs61a.org/">Python Tutor</a> for drawing environment diagrams</li>
  <li><p><a href="../office-hours.html">Office hours</a> are a great way to get drop-in help from the course staff</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://upe.cs.berkeley.edu/oh/">UPE</a>, <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/tutor/">HKN</a>, and <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/academic-support/tutoring-schedule#ac888">CoE</a> all offer free drop-in tutoring</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, forming study groups is a very effective strategy for enhancing learning. We
know this class is huge so we've made a
<a href="https://piazza.com/class/jc559y99w0i4jj?cid=1622">Piazza post</a> to help you find
study buddies!</p>

The staff will review the topic and go over practice problems. There are multiple times for each topic so don't fret if you can't make a certain time!
