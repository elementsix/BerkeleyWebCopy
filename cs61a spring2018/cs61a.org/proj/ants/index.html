<p>In this project, you will create a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense</a> game called Ants Vs.
SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you
can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade
your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they
will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your
queen will succumb to the bees' wrath.  This game is inspired by PopCap Games'
<a href="http://www.popcap.com/plants-vs-zombies-1">Plants Vs. Zombies</a>.</p>

<p>This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms,
focusing on the material from <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/25-object-oriented-programming.html">Chapter 2.5</a> of Composing Programs. The
project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>



<p>This is a 11-day project. You may work with one other partner.
You should not share your code with students who are not your partner or copy
from anyone else's solutions. In the end, you will submit one project for both
partners.</p>



<p>Remember that you can earn an additional bonus point by submitting the
project at least 24 hours before the deadline.</p>



<p>The project is worth 27 points. 24 points are assigned for correctness, 1 point for
submitting Phases 1-2 by the checkpoint date, and 2 points for the overall
<a href="#">composition</a>.</p>


<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ants.py</code></li>
  <li><code>mytests.rst</code> (ungraded)</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --submit</code></pre>

<p>You will be able to view your submissions on the <a
  href="http://ok.cs61a.org/">Ok dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p>However, please do <b>not</b> modify any other functions.  Doing so may
result in your code failing our autograder tests. Also, please do not
change any function signatures (names, argument order, or number of
arguments).</p>



<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code.
It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems.
However, you should not be testing <i>too</i> often, to allow yourself time to
think through problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you
with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the
autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your Ok account using your web
browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run <code>ok</code>, it will back up
your work and progress on our servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations, but
there are two things you should be aware of.</p>

<p>First, some of the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests, run the
following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>
=====================================================================
Assignment: Ants Vs. SomeBees
Ok, version ...
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Code here
?
</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you
are correct, then this test case will be available the next time you run the
autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check the
correctness of your program using the tests that you have unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question. Use the
<code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>

<!-- <p>Second, there may be some test cases that are <i>hidden</i>. These test cases are
<b>not</b> run by the command:</p> -->

<!--<pre>python3 ok</pre>-->

<!-- <p>They are only run when you submit:</p> -->

<!-- <pre>python3 ok --submit</pre> -->

<!-- <p> We keep test cases hidden to ensure that you write your code with the intention
of solving the question at hand, not purely to pass the given tests. The hidden
tests will be run when you submit your project. You will receive an email with part of
the autograder results after submitting. However, the autograder has a 15 minute
cooldown period. If you submit before 15 minutes have passed, the autograder will
not run.</p> -->

<p>We recommend that you submit <b>after you finish each
problem</b>. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us
to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue.</p>

<!--<p>After you run this command, you will receive an email (to the address-->
<!--that you used to sign up for Ok) that has the output from all <i>failed</i>-->
<!--unlocked tests, including hidden tests, along with your score at the bottom. You-->
<!--can continue submitting until you pass all the tests. However, you will receive-->
<!--<b>at most one email every half hour</b>.</p>-->

<!--<p>This buffer period is meant for you and your partner to try and understand-->
<!--where your error comes from, and take some time to think through your code. We-->
<!--encourage you to do this for all projects.</p>-->

<!---
<p>If you are trying to debug a test failure, you can launch an interactive session
after the test is run with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>This will run the tests and launch an interactive session if a test does not
pass.</p>

<p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so
<b>do not modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="ants.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p>

<p>If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about
your progress, use the <code>--local</code> option when invoking
<code>ok</code>.  With this option, no information will be sent to our course
servers.

<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>


<p>A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new
bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are placed.  Finally, all insects
(ants, then bees) take individual actions. Bees either try to move toward the
end of the tunnel or they sting ants in their way. Ants perform a different
action depending on their type, such as throwing leaves at the bees. The game
ends either when a bee reaches the ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee
flotilla has been vanquished (you win).</p>

<center>
  <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/new_ants_gui.png" style="border: 1px solid #000;"/>
</center>


<h3 id="core-concepts">Core concepts</h3>


<p><strong>The Colony</strong>. This is where the game takes place. The colony consists of
several <em>places</em> that are chained together to form a tunnel where bees can
travel through. The colony has some quantity of food that can be expended to
deploy ant troops.</p>

<p><strong>Places</strong>. A place links to another place to form a tunnel. The player can
place a single ant into each place. However, there can be many bees in a single
place.</p>

<p><strong>The Hive</strong>. This is the place where bees originate. Bees exit the hive to enter
the ant colony.</p>

<p><strong>Ants</strong>. Ants are the usable troops in the game that the player places into
the colony. Each type of ant takes a different action and requires a different
amount of food to place. The two most basic ant types are the <code>HarvesterAnt</code>,
which adds one food to the colony during each turn, and the <code>ThrowerAnt</code>, which
throws a leaf at a bee each turn. You will be implementing many more.</p>

<p><strong>Bees</strong>. Bees are the antogonistic troops in the game that the player must
defend the colony from. Each turn, a bee either advances to the next place in
the tunnel if no ant is in its way, or it stings the ant in its way. Bees win
when at least one bee reaches the end of a tunnel.</p>

<p><strong>Queen Ant</strong>: There is one queen ant in the whole colony. She is able to
attack bees but she also has a special ability of fortifying the other ant
troops. Bees can also win if they destroy the queen ant.</p>


<h3 id="core-classes">Core classes</h3>


<p>The concepts described above each have a corresponding class that encapsulates
the logic for that concept. Here is a summary of the main classes involved in
this game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>AntColony</code>: Represents the colony and some state information about the game,
  including how much food is available, how much time has elapsed, where the
  <code>QueenAnt</code> resides, and all the <code>Place</code>s in the game.</li>
  <li><code>Place</code>: Represents a single place that holds insects. At most one <code>Ant</code> can
  be in a single place, but there can be many <code>Bee</code>s. <code>Place</code> objects have an
  <code>exit</code> and an <code>entrance</code> which are also places. Bees travel through a tunnel
  tunnel by moving to a <code>Place</code>'s <code>exit</code>.</li>
  <li><code>Hive</code>: Represents the hive where <code>Bee</code>s start out.</li>
  <li><code>Insect</code>: A superclass for <code>Ant</code> and <code>Bee</code>. All insects have an <code>armor</code>
  attribute, their remaining health, and a <code>place</code> attribute, the <code>Place</code> where
  they are currently located. Each turn, every active <code>Insect</code> in the game
  performs its <code>action</code>.</li>
  <li><code>Ant</code>: Represents ants. Each <code>Ant</code> subclass has special attributes or a
  special <code>action</code> that distinguish it from other <code>Ant</code> types. For example, a
  <code>HarvesterAnt</code> gets food for the colony and a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> attacks <code>Bee</code>s.
  Each ant type also has a <code>food_cost</code> attribute that indicates how much it
  costs to deploy one unit of that type of ant.</li>
  <li><code>Bee</code>: Represents bees. Each turn, a bee either moves to the <code>exit</code> of its
  current <code>Place</code> if no ant blocks its path, or stings an ant that blocks its
  path.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the game</h3>


<p>The game can be run in two modes: as a text-based game or using a
graphical user interface (GUI). The game logic is the same in either
case, but the GUI enforces a turn time limit that makes playing the
game more exciting. The text-based interface is provided for debugging
and development.</p>

<p>The files are separated according to these two modes.  <code>ants.py</code> knows
nothing of graphics or turn time limits.</p>

<p>To start a text-based game, run</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants.py</code></pre>

<p>To start a graphical game, run</p>

<pre><code>python3 gui.py</code></pre>

<p>To start an older version of the graphics, run</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>When you start the graphical version, a new window should appear. In the
starter implementation, you have unlimited food and your ants only throw leaves
at bees in their current <code>Place</code>. Try playing the game anyway! You'll need to
place a lot of <code>ThrowerAnt</code>s (the second type) in order to keep the bees from
reaching your queen.</p>

<p>The game has several options that you will use throughout the project,
which you can view with <code>python3 ants.py &#x2d;&#x2d;help</code>.</p>

<pre><code>usage: ants.py [&#x2d;h] [&#x2d;d DIFFICULTY] [&#x2d;w] [&#x2d;&#x2d;food FOOD]

Play Ants vs. SomeBees

optional arguments:
  &#x2d;h, &#x2d;&#x2d;help     show this help message and exit
  &#x2d;d DIFFICULTY  sets difficulty of game (test/easy/medium/hard/insane)
  &#x2d;w, &#x2d;&#x2d;water    loads a full layout with water
  &#x2d;&#x2d;food FOOD    number of food to start with when testing</code></pre>


<h2 id="your-own-test-cases">Your own test cases</h2>


<blockquote><p>Adding your own tests is <strong>entirely optional</strong>; you will not lose points if you
submit an empty <code>mytests.rst</code> file.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>We highly recommend that you add your own tests as you work through the
project.</strong> It's a really helpful way to speed up the debugging process and
improve your understanding of the code.</p>

<p>The course staff has also made an
<a href="https://youtu.be/o1TD0K1xWXs">instructional video</a> summarizing the information
below.</p>


<h3 id="adding-tests">Adding tests</h3>


<p><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/custom_test.png" alt="Custom Test Example"></p>

<p>Adding tests is easy. Directly edit the <code>mytests.rst</code> file included with the
Ants project. We provide a sample structure to start from, but the test format
is actually quite flexible. Here are some simple rules to follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow standard Python doctest format. This is what we mostly use for the Ok
  tests, so feel free to use those as examples.</li>
  <li>For the most part, you may use whitespace as you'd like, but we recommend
  keeping it organized for your own sake.</li>
  <li>Generally, smaller, simpler tests will be more useful than larger, more
  complex tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also find our
<a href="../../articles/debugging.html#debugging-process">debugging guide</a> helpful. If you're
stuck on a particularly tricky <code>Ok</code> test case, a good first step would be to
break it up into small parts and test them out yourself in <code>mytests.rst</code>.</p>


<h3 id="running-tests">Running tests</h3>


<p>To run all your tests in <code>mytests.rst</code> with verbose results:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;t &#x2d;v</code></pre>

<p>If you put your tests in a different file or split your tests up into multiple
files:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;t your_new_filename.rst</code></pre>

<p>To run just the tests from suite 1 case 1 in <code>mytests.rst</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;t &#x2d;&#x2d;suite 1 &#x2d;&#x2d;case 1</code></pre>

<p>You might have noticed that there's a "test coverage" percentage for your tests
(note that coverage statistics are only returned when running all tests). This
is a measure of your test's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">code coverage</a>. If you're
interested, you can find more information in our
<a href="../../articles/using-ok.html#running-your-own-tests">reference guide</a>.</p>


<h2 id="phase-1-basic-gameplay">Phase 1: Basic gameplay</h2>


<blockquote><p><strong>Important submission note</strong>: For full credit,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submit with Phases 1-2 complete by <strong>Monday, March 5</strong> (worth 1 pt).</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>In the first phase you will complete the implementation that will allow for
basic gameplay with the two basic <code>Ant</code>s: the <code>HarvesterAnt</code> and the
<code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</p>


<h3 id="problem-0-0-pt">Problem 0 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>Answer the following questions with your partner after you have read the
<em>entire</em> <code>ants.py</code> file. If you cannot answer these questions, read the file
again, consult the core concepts/classes sections above, or ask a question in
the Question 0 thread on Piazza.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the significance of an insect's <code>armor</code> attribute? Does this value
  change? If so, how?</li>
  <li>What are all of the attributes of the <code>Ant</code> class?</li>
  <li>Is the <code>armor</code> attribute of the <code>Ant</code> class an instance attribute or class
  attribute? Why?</li>
  <li>Is the <code>damage</code> attribute of an <code>Ant</code> subclass (such as ThrowerAnt) an instance attribute or class
  attribute? Why?</li>
  <li>Which class do both <code>Ant</code> and <code>Bee</code> inherit from?</li>
  <li>What do instances of Ant and instances of Bee have in common?</li>
  <li>How many insects can be in a single Place at any given time (until Phase 6
  is complete)?</li>
</ol>

<p>You can test your understanding by running</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 00 &#x2d;u</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-1-1-pt">Problem 1 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>First, add food costs and implement harvesters. Currently, there is no cost
for deploying any type of <code>Ant</code>, and so there is no challenge to the
game. You'll notice that <code>Ant</code> starts out with a base <code>food_cost</code> of
zero. Override this value in each of the subclasses listed below with
the correct costs.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food Cost</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/insects/ant_harvester.gif" /> <br> <code>HarvesterAnt</code></td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/insects/ant_thrower.gif" /> <br> <code>ThrowerAnt</code></td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </td>
</table>

<p>Now that deploying <code>Ant</code>s cost food, we need to be able gather more food!
To fix this issue, implement the <code>HarvesterAnt</code> class. A <code>HarvesterAnt</code> is a
type of <code>Ant</code> that adds one food to the <code>colony.food</code> total as its <code>action</code>.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, test your understanding of the problem:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>After writing code, test your implementation:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01</code></pre>

<p>Try playing the game again (<code>python3 gui.py</code>). Once you have placed a
<code>HarvesterAnt</code>, you should accumulate food each turn. You can also place
<code>ThrowerAnt</code>s, but you'll see that they can only attack bees that are in their
<code>Place</code>, so it'll be a little difficult to win.</p>


<h3 id="problem-2-2-pt">Problem 2 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Complete the <code>Place</code> constructor by adding code that tracks entrances. Right
now, a <code>Place</code> keeps track only of its <code>exit</code>. We would like a <code>Place</code> to keep
track of its entrance as well. A <code>Place</code> needs to track only one <code>entrance</code>.
Tracking entrances will be useful when an <code>Ant</code> needs to see what <code>Bee</code>s are in
front of it in the tunnel.</p>

<p>However, simply passing an entrance to a <code>Place</code> constructor will be
problematic; we would need to have both the exit and the entrance before
creating a <code>Place</code>! (It's a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg">chicken or the

following way instead. The <code>Place</code> constructor should specify that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A newly created <code>Place</code> always starts with its <code>entrance</code> as <code>None</code>.</li>
  <li>If the <code>Place</code> has an <code>exit</code>, then the <code>exit</code>'s <code>entrance</code> is set to
  that <code>Place</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order for a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> to attack, it must know which bee it should hit.
The provided implementation of the <code>nearest_bee</code> method in the <code>ThrowerAnt</code>
class only allows them to hit bees in the same <code>Place</code>. Your job is to fix it
so that a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> will <code>throw_at</code> the nearest bee in front of it that is
not still in the <code>Hive</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>nearest_bee</code> method returns a random <code>Bee</code> from the nearest place that
contains bees. Places are inspected in order by following their <code>entrance</code>
attributes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start from the current <code>Place</code> of the <code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</li>
  <li>For each place, return a random bee if there is any, or consider the

<h2 id="phase-2-ants-attack">Phase 2: Ants Attack</h2>


<p>Now that you've implemented basic gameplay with two types of <code>Ant</code>s, let's
add some flavor to the ways ants can attack bees. In this phase, you'll be
implementing several different <code>Ant</code>s with different offensive capabilities.</p>

<p>After you implement each <code>Ant</code> subclass in this section, you'll need to set its
<code>implemented</code> attribute to <code>True</code> so that that type of ant will show up in the
GUI. Feel free to try out the game with each new ant to test the functionality!</p>

<p>With your Phase 2 ants, try <code>python3 ants_gui.py &#x2d;d easy</code> to play against a
full swarm of bees in a multi-tunnel layout and try <code>&#x2d;d normal</code>, <code>&#x2d;d hard</code>, or
<code>&#x2d;d insane</code> if you want a real challenge! If the bees are too numerous to
vanquish, you might need to create some new ants.</p>


<h3 id="problem-4-2-pt">Problem 4 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>The <code>ThrowerAnt</code> is a great offensive unit, but it'd be nice to have a cheaper
unit that can throw. Implement two subclasses of <code>ThrowerAnt</code> that are less
costly but have constraints on the distance they can throw:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>LongThrower</code> can only <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is found after following
  at least 5 <code>entrance</code> transitions. It cannot hit <code>Bee</code>s that are in the same
  <code>Place</code> as it or the first 4 <code>Place</code>s in front of it. If there are two
  <code>Bees</code>, one too close to the <code>LongThrower</code> and the other within its range,
  the <code>LongThrower</code> should throw past the closer <code>Bee</code>, instead targeting the
  farther one, which is within its range.</li>
  <li>The <code>ShortThrower</code> can only <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is found after following
  at most 3 <code>entrance</code> transitions. It can only hit <code>Bee</code>s in the same <code>Place</code>
  as it and 3 <code>Place</code>s in front of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these specialized throwers can <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is exactly 4
<code>Place</code>s away. Placing a single one of these (and no other ants) should never
win a default game.</p>

<p>A good way to approach the implementation to <code>ShortThrower</code> and <code>LongThrower</code>
is to have it inherit the <code>nearest_bee</code> method from the base <code>ThrowerAnt</code>
class. The logic of choosing which bee a thrower ant will attack is essentially
the same, except the <code>ShortThrower</code> and <code>LongThrower</code> ants have maximum and
minimum ranges, respectively.</p>

<p>To implement these behaviors, you may need to modify the <code>nearest_bee</code> method
to reference <code>min_range</code> and <code>max_range</code> attributes, and only return a bee that
is in range.</p>

<p>The original <code>ThrowerAnt</code> has no minimum or maximum range, so make sure that
its <code>min_range</code> and <code>max_range</code> attributes should reflect that.  Then,
implement the subclasses <code>LongThrower</code> and <code>ShortThrower</code> with appropriately
constrained ranges and correct food costs.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em> <code>float(&#x27;inf&#x27;)</code> returns an infinite positive value represented as a

<code>ShortThrower</code> to <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>Implement the <code>FireAnt</code>. A <code>FireAnt</code> has a special <code>reduce_armor</code> method: when
the <code>FireAnt</code>'s armor reaches zero or lower, it will reduce the armor of <em>all</em>

<p>Give <code>HungryAnt</code> a <code>time_to_digest</code> class attribute that holds the number of

it has left to digest (default is 0, since it hasn't eaten anything at the

<p>Implement the <code>action</code> method of the <code>HungryAnt</code> to check if it's digesting; if

<p>A <code>NinjaAnt</code> does not block the path of a <code>Bee</code> that flies by. To implement
this behavior, first modify the <code>Ant</code> class to include a new class attribute
<code>blocks_path</code> that is <code>True</code> by default. Set the value of <code>blocks_path</code> to

<p>Second, modify the <code>Bee</code>'s method <code>blocked</code> to return <code>False</code> if either
there is no <code>Ant</code> in the <code>Bee</code>'s <code>place</code> or if there is an <code>Ant</code>, but
its <code>blocks_path</code> attribute is <code>False</code>. Now <code>Bee</code>s will just fly past
<code>NinjaAnt</code>s.</p>

<p>Finally, we want to make the <code>NinjaAnt</code> damage all <code>Bee</code>s that fly past.
Implement the <code>action</code> method in <code>NinjaAnt</code> to reduce the armor of all <code>Bee</code>s

<p>We are going to add some protection to our glorious <code>AntColony</code> by implementing

<p>Right now, our ants are quite frail. We'd like to provide a way to help them
last longer against the onslaught of the bees. Enter the <code>BodyguardAnt</code>.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food Cost</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>

    <td>4</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A <code>BodyguardAnt</code> differs from a normal ant because it is a <code>container</code>; it can
contain another ant and protect it, all in one <code>Place</code>. When a <code>Bee</code> stings the
ant in a <code>Place</code> where one ant contains another, only the container is
damaged. The ant inside the container can still perform its original action.
If the container perishes, the contained ant still remains in the place (and
can then be damaged).</p>

<p>Each <code>BodyguardAnt</code> has an instance attribute <code>ant</code> that stores the ant it
contains. It initially starts off as <code>None</code>, to indicate that no ant is being
protected. Implement the <code>contain_ant</code> method so that it sets the bodyguard's
<code>ant</code> instance attribute to the passed in <code>ant</code> argument. Also implement the
<code>BodyguardAnt</code>'s <code>action</code> method to perform its <code>ant</code>'s action if it is currently
containing an ant.</p>

<p>In addition, you will need to make the following modifications throughout your
program so that a container and its contained ant can both occupy a place at
the same time (a maximum of two ants per place), but only if exactly one is a
<code>container</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add an <code>Ant.container</code> class attribute that indicates whether a
  subclass of <code>Ant</code> is a container. For all <code>Ant</code> instances, except for
  <code>BodyguardAnt</code> instances, <code>container</code> should be <code>False</code>. The
  <code>BodyguardAnt.container</code> attribute should be <code>True</code>.</li>
  <li><p>Implement the method <code>Ant.can_contain</code> which takes an <code>other</code> ant as an
  argument and returns <code>True</code> if:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>This ant is a container.</li>
    <li>This ant does not already contain another ant.</li>
    <li>The other ant is not a container.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p>Modify <code>Place.add_insect</code> to allow a container and a non-container ant
  to occupy the same place according to the following rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the <code>ant</code> currently occupying a <code>Place</code> can contain the <code>insect</code>
    (an <code>Ant</code>) passed to <code>add_insect</code>, then it does.</li>
    <li>If the <code>insect</code> (an <code>Ant</code>) passed to <code>add_insect</code> can contain the
    <code>ant</code> currently occupying a <code>Place</code>, then it does. Also,
    set the <code>Place</code>'s <code>ant</code> to be the container insect.</li>
    <li>If neither <code>Ant</code> can contain the other, raise the same
    <code>AssertionError</code> as before (the one already present in the starter
    code).</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>BodyguardAnt</code> provides great defense, but they say the best defense is a
good offense. The <code>TankAnt</code> is a container that protects an ant in its place

<p>In the final phase, you're going to add one last kick to the game by
introducing a new type of place and new ants that are able to occupy this
place. One of these ants is the most important ant of them all: the queen of
the colony.</p>


<h3 id="problem-11-1-pt">Problem 11 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Let's add water to the colony! Currently there are only two types of places, the
<code>Hive</code> and a basic <code>Place</code>. To make things more interesting, we're going to
create a new type of <code>Place</code> called <code>Water</code>.</p>

<p>Only an ant that is <code>watersafe</code> can be deployed to a <code>Water</code> place. In order
to determine whether an <code>Insect</code> is <code>watersafe</code>, add a new attribute to the
<code>Insect</code> class named <code>watersafe</code> that is <code>False</code> by default. Since bees can fly,
make their <code>watersafe</code> attribute <code>True</code>,
overriding the default.</p>

<p>Now, implement the <code>add_insect</code> method for <code>Water</code>. First call
<code>Place.add_insect</code> to add the insect, regardless of whether it is watersafe.
Then, if the insect is not watersafe, reduce the insect's armor to 0 by invoking
<code>reduce_armor</code>. <em>Do not copy and paste code.</em> Instead, use methods that have
already been defined and make use of inheritance to reuse the functionality of
the <code>Place</code> class.</p>

<h3 id="problem-12-1-pt">Problem 12 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Currently there are no ants that can be placed on <code>Water</code>. Implement the
<code>ScubaThrower</code>, which is a subclass of <code>ThrowerAnt</code> that is more costly and
<code>watersafe</code>, but otherwise identical to its base class. A <code>ScubaThrower</code> should
not lose its armor when placed in <code>Water</code>.</p>

<p>We have not provided you with a class header. Implement the <code>ScubaThrower</code>
class from scratch. Give it a class attribute <code>name</code> with the value <code>&#x27;Scuba&#x27;</code>

<code>implemented</code> with the value <code>True</code> (so that you can use it in a game).</p>

<h3 id="problem-13-4-pt">Problem 13 (4 pt)</h3>


<p>Finally, implement the <code>QueenAnt</code>. The queen is a waterproof <code>ScubaThrower</code>
that inspires her fellow ants through her bravery. The <code>QueenAnt</code> doubles the
damage of all the ants behind her each time she performs an action. Once an
ant's damage has been doubled, it is <em>not</em> doubled again for subsequent turns.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>

    <td>7</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>However, with great power comes great responsibility. The <code>QueenAnt</code> is
governed by three special rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the queen ever has its armor reduced to 0, the bees win. The bees also
  still win if any bee reaches the end of a tunnel. You can call <code>bees_win()</code>
  to signal to the simulator that the game is over.</li>
  <li>There can be only one true queen. Any queen instantiated beyond the first
  one is an impostor, and should have its armor reduced to 0 upon taking its
  first action, without doubling any ant's damage or throwing anything. If an
  impostor dies, the game should still continue as normal.</li>
  <li>The true (first) queen cannot be removed. Attempts to remove the queen
  should have no effect (but should not cause an error). You will need to
  modify the <code>remove_insect</code> method of <code>Place</code> to enforce this condition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some hints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All instances of the same class share the same class attributes. How can
  you use this information to tell whether a QueenAnt instance is the true
  QueenAnt?</li>
  <li>You can find each <code>Place</code> in a tunnel behind the <code>QueenAnt</code> by starting at
  the ant's <code>place.exit</code> and then repeatedly following its <code>exit</code>. To detect
  whether a <code>Place</code> is at the end of a tunnel, check whether its <code>exit</code> is
  <code>None</code>.</li>
  <li>To make sure that you don't double the damage of the same ant twice,
  maintain a list of all the ants that have been doubled.</li>
  <li>Remember that there can be two ants in the same place; if this is the case,
  make sure to double both their damage attributes.</li>
  <li><p>You may find the <code>isinstance</code> function useful for checking if something is
  an instance of an object. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(a, Foo)
True</code></pre></li>

  <li><code>make_slow</code> is an effect that takes an <code>action</code> method and returns a new
  <code>action</code> method that performs the original action on turns where
  <code>colony.time</code> is even and does nothing on other turns.</li>
  <li><code>make_stun</code> is an effect that takes an <code>action</code> method and returns a new
  <code>action</code> method that does nothing.</li>
  <li><code>apply_effect</code> takes an <code>effect</code> (either <code>make_slow</code> or <code>make_stun</code>), a
  <code>Bee</code>, and a <code>duration</code>. It uses the effect on the <code>Bee</code>'s <code>.action</code> method
  to produce a new <code>action</code> method, and then arranges to have the new method
  become the bee's action method for the next <code>duration</code> times that <code>.action</code>
  is called, after which the previous <code>.action</code> method is restored.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can run some provided tests, but they are not exhaustive:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q EC &#x2d;u
python3 ok &#x2d;q EC</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to test your code!  Your code should be able to apply
multiple effects on a target; each new effect applies to the current
(possibly affected) action method of the bee.</p>

<p><strong>You are now done with the project!</strong>  If you haven't yet, you should try
playing the game! There are two GUIs that you can use. The first is a new
browser GUI that has fancy graphics and animations. The command to run it is:</p>

<pre><code>python3 gui.py [&#x2d;h] [&#x2d;d DIFFICULTY] [&#x2d;w] [&#x2d;&#x2d;food FOOD]</code></pre>

<p>The second is an older, but tried-and-true interface that we have been using
over the past few years. The command to run it is:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants_gui.py [&#x2d;h] [&#x2d;d DIFFICULTY] [&#x2d;w] [&#x2d;&#x2d;food FOOD]</code></pre>

<p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> Tom Magrino and Eric Tzeng developed this project
with John DeNero.  Jessica Wan contributed the original artwork. Joy Jeng and
Mark Miyashita invented the queen ant. Many others have contributed to
the project as well!</p>

<p>Colin Schoen developed the new browser GUI. The beautiful new artwork was drawn
by the efforts of Alana Tran, Andrew Huang, Emilee Chen, Jessie Salas, Jingyi
Li, Katherine Xu, Meena Vempaty, Michelle Chang, and Ryan Davis.</p>
