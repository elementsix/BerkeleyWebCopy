         Hey everyone! I'm Alex and I'm a junior majoring in CS. Cool fact: one of my proudest accomplishments is a 10+ page paper on Kanye West’s “The College Dropout”. If you ever find me, I’m probably procrastinating by looking for new music or watching/playing basketball. Feel free to talk to me about anything like Kendrick Lamar, Radiohead (being the best band of all time), the Lakers, or how amazing HashMaps are.

         Hello! I'm a third year EECS and Music major. I grew up in upstate New York and finished high school in Kentucky. In past semesters, I TA'd EE16A, but am now jumping ship to the CS side. On Sundays, you can hear me playing (trying to play) the Campanile bells. In my free time, I like to play tennis and throw around frisbees. My favorite restaurant was Eatsa, until it closed. Looking forward to meeting all of you!

         Hi! I'm Ashley :) I'm a second-year CS major from Cupertino, CA. Some (kind of) fun things about me: I am a big fan of reading, both books and stuff online (Quora and Reddit are my favorites). I am also a huge fan of cats. My favorite kind of food is noodle soup, especially pho, ramen, and beef noodle soup. I love talking to people and hearing about people's lives. Looking forward to a great semester and getting to know you all ^_^ !

         Hi! My name’s Josh, and I’m a third year CS major from the Bay Area. I enjoy baking, head bumping to rap music (J.Cole/Chance/Big Sean/Drake), and eating burritos. I’m also Vice President of the Cal Fencing Club. I really love teaching CS, and I hope to meet as many of you as possible this semester. I’m always down to talk, so feel free to reach out to me!

         Hello! I'm a third year CS major who started studying CS because of Neopets! I love coffee ice-cream (but don't drink coffee) and watching cooking shows (but I can't actually cook). You can always find me raving about the TV show The West Wing or trying to get my friends to play games with me. When I was in kindergarten, I used to teach an imaginary class on my small whiteboard; six-year-old me and twenty-year-old me are overjoyed to have a real class to teach now. 🙂

I'm a 3rd year CS major from Cupertino, CA, and this will be my second semester being involved with CS 61B, which has been my favorite course at Cal (and the reason I'm no longer MCB). The two loves of my life are dogs and food, so outside of class you can find me dogspotting or browsing Yelp for new restaurants to try (hmu with recommendations!!). I also like to take naps and can tell you the locations of several nap-friendly couches on campus.

         Hello! I'm Lauren, a second-year Computer Science major from Huntington Beach, California (also known as Surf City!). When I'm not studying CS, I enjoy introspecting, going for a long run, binge-watching Korean dramas, jamming out on Spotify, and eating a shameful amount of good food. Looking forward to a great semester together! :]

         greetings!  I am a second year CS major and music minor.  In my free time, I like to fiddle around on different instruments, milly rock, hang out with my fellowship, and waste away watching Planet Earth.  61B is my favorite class to date and I'm excited to share my passion for spicy data structures with you all.  Feel free to say hi to me or email me anytime.

         Hi! I'm a third year Computer Science & Integrative Human Biology major from the Bay Area. While I'm not doing CS, I like dancing, eating avocados, and contemplating the universe. CS 61B has been my favorite class at Cal so far, and I hope it's yours too!

         Hey guys, Riley here! I'm a 3rd year studying computer science and minoring in Spanish. As the minor suggests, I like languages; I'm also in my 2nd semester of Korean right now. Apart from that, I play for Cal's B-team for Ultimate Frisbee (ThugMo), I'm a research assistant for a psychology lab, post memes frequently on UCBMFET, enjoy running, and solve Rubik's Cubes competitively. I really enjoyed 61B and hope you do too!

         Hey there! I'm a third-year CS major from the south bay. Outside of class, I'm a huge fan of playing board games (Avalon is great) and Badminton! If you want to talk about your favorite board games or anything at all, I'd love to chat! You can also find me at the RSF for Badminton open gyms on Tuesdays and Thursdays!
