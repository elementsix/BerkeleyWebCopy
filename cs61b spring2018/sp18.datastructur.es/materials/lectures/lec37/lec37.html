<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Summary.</strong> The sort problem is to take a sequence of objects and put them into
the correct order. The search problem is to store a collection of objects such
that they can be rapidly retrieved (i.e. how do we implement a Map or Set). We
made the obersvation that BST maps are roughly analagous to comparison based
sorting, and hash maps are roughly analagous to counting based (a.k.a. integer)
sorting. We observed that we have a 3rd type of sort, which involves sorting by
digit, which raised the question: What sort of data structure is analogous to
LSD or MSD sort?</p>

<p><strong>Terminology.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Length of string key usually represented by L.</li>
  <li>Alphabet size usually represented by R.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tries.</strong> Analogous to LSD sort. Know how to insert and search for an item in a
Trie. Know that Trie nodes typically do not contain letters, and that instead
letters are stored implicitly on edge links. Know that there are many ways of
storing these links, and that the fastest but most memory hungry way is with an
array of size R. We call such tries R-way tries.</p>

<p><strong>TSTs.</strong> Instead of R links, a TST node has only 3 links. Know how to insert
and search for an item in a ternary search trie. Be aware that TSTs can become
unbalanced. (As an aside that we won’t cover in class, TSTs are analgous to a
sort known as 3-way radix quicksort, which is just quicksort applied digit by
digit). Each node typically contains a character, except the root, which
contains no character.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of Tries and TSTs.</strong> Both flavors of tries have very fast lookup
times, as we only ever look at as many characters as they are in the data we’re
trying to retrieve. However, their chief advantage is the ability to efficiently
support various operations not supported by other map/set implementations
including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>longestPrefixOf</li>
  <li>prefixMatches</li>
  <li>spell checking</li>
</ul>

<!--**Speed migitag.** The speedup for tries is diminished in impact by the fact that retrieving digits one-by-one in a language like Java is likely to be a lot slower than retrieval all at one (as we might imagine a built in comparison function).

Another not-so-important note: Another potential advantage of a trie over other datatypes is a more efficient use of space, given that the same letter may be shared by many strings. However, in practice, tries tend to require more memory than a naive String implementation because of the high cost of storing a bunch of links and the fact that strings don't tend to overlap THAT much. -->

<!--You should be able to build either an R-way Trie and TST. You should be able to search in either a R-way Trie and TST. You should be able to delete from an R-way trie. You should appreciate how a TST can become unbalanced with inserts.
Given a graphical depiction of either an R-way trie or TST, you should be able to tell which keys are in the trie.
Hash Tables and LLRBs with String keys
With String keys, we don't want to think about counting compareTo() or hashCode() and equals() calls. Why? What do we think about instead?
Know (but you do not have to prove) that LLRBs take order of growth lg2 N charAt() calls to compare random strings. Based on this, a hit is order L + lg2 N.
Understand why hash tables are L charAt() calls on a hit or miss (assuming no collisions!)
Tries
Special structure such that you only look at each letter one time. Trivially, misses and hits have a maximum run time of L.
Be aware that for random inputs, search misses only take an average of logR N.
Why do R-way tries use such a huge amount of memory? How much memory in terms of L and R?
What are the two ways of determining that a key does not exist in a trie?
TSTS
When looking for a single character, why is it possible to follow as many as R links before you complete the search for that character?
If the TST is balanced, typical case inserts and hits cost L + lg N character compares, and typical misses cost lg N character compares.
If the TST is not balanced, worst case hits, misses, and inserts all include H, where H is the height of the tree.-->

<h2 id="recommended-problems">Recommended Problems</h2>

<p>Throughout, we define R as the size of the alphabet, and N as the number of
items in a trie.</p>

<h3 id="a-level">A level</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What is the worst case runtime to find a single character string in a
perfectly balanced TST in terms of R and N?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many different data structures that we can use to store the
children of an R-way trie node. The simplest but most memory hungry choice is
to create an array of length R, with one link per character in the trie. A
second choice is to have each node contain a TreeMap that maps a given
character to the appropriate node. A third choice is to use HashMaps instead
of TreeMaps. is to have each node contain a TreeMaps, some of you used R-way
trie nodes that contained HashMaps, and some of you used TST nodes. For the
“average” node, which of these three choices is likely to use the most
memory? Why does this mean that this type of node takes longer to construct?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose we use an R-way trie to implement a set. For each of the three
implementations of an R-way trie node described in problem 2, what are the
best and worst case key lookup times in terms of R an N?</p>
