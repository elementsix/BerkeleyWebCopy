<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this lab, you’ll create a package named <code class="highlighter-rouge">creature</code> that will implement two creatures (or more, if you’d like) that will inhabit a world simulated by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">huglife</code> package. Along the way we’ll learn how to debug small pieces of a much larger system, even if those small pieces happen to live inside another package.</p>

<h4 id="huglife">HugLife</h4>

<p>First, pull the Lab 15 starter files:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git pull skeleton master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Start the lab by booting up the HugLife simulator. To do this, import the project into IntelliJ and run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">huglife.HugLife</code> class with a single command line argument <code class="highlighter-rouge">samplesolo</code>.</p>

<!--
Or alternately, use the following commands from the command line (make sure you're in the `lab15` directory):

    $ javac -g huglife/*.java creatures/*.java
    $ java huglife.HugLife samplesolo
-->

<p>This starts up a world called <code class="highlighter-rouge">samplesolo</code>. You should see a little red square wandering around randomly.</p>

<p>The creatures you’ll create in this assignment will go in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">creatures/</code> directory, in these two files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip.java</code> (skeleton provided)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Clorus.java</code> (you’ll need to create this)</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually these two types of creatures will also inhabit the world, and unlike this red guy, they actually do <a href="http://i.imgur.com/E2Kdowq.gifv" target="_blank">something interesting</a>.</p>

<p>These classes will extend the <tt>huglife.Creature</tt> class, which provides a template that all creatures should follow.</p>

<h4 id="how-the-simulator-works">How the simulator works</h4>

<p>Creatures live on an NxN grid, with no wraparound. Each square may be empty, impassible, or contain exactly one creature. At each tic (timestep), exactly one creature takes a single action. Creatures choose actions in a round-robin fashion.</p>

<p>There is a global queue of all creatures in the world, waiting their turn to take an action. When a creature is at the front of the queue, the world simulator tells that creature who its four neighbors are and requests a choice of action from the creature. More specifically, the world simulator calls the creature’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">chooseAction()</code> method, which takes as an argument a collection of all four neighbors. Based on the identity of the four neighbors, the creature then chooses one of exactly five actions: MOVE, REPLICATE, ATTACK, STAY, or DIE.</p>

<p>MOVE, REPLICATE, and ATTACK are directional actions, and STAY and DIE are stationary actions. If a creature takes a directional action, it must specify either a direction or a location. For example, if the acting creature sees a creature to its LEFT that it can eat, it might choose to ATTACK LEFT.</p>

<p>One of your main tasks for this lab is to write the code that makes Creature decisions. Actions are returned as objects of type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Action</code>, which are fully described in <code class="highlighter-rouge">huglife/Action.java</code>.</p>

<p>After a creature chooses an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Action</code>, the simulator enacts the changes to the world grid. You’ll be responsible for writing the code that tracks the state of each creature. For example, after the acting creature eats another creature, the acting Creature might become stronger, die, change colors, etc.</p>

<p>This will be accomplished by a <em>callback</em> to the creature, which is required to provide <code class="highlighter-rouge">move()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">replicate()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">attack()</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">stay()</code> methods that describe how the state of the acting creature will evolve after each of these respective actions.</p>

<p>For example, if your creature chooses to replicate upwards by returning <code class="highlighter-rouge">new Action(Action.ActionType.REPLICATE, Direction.TOP)</code>, then the game simulator is guaranteed to later call the <code class="highlighter-rouge">replicate()</code> method of the creature that made this choice.</p>

<h2 id="experimenting-with-the-sample-creature">Experimenting with the Sample Creature</h2>

<p>Open up <code class="highlighter-rouge">Occupant.java</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Creature.java</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleCreature.java</code>, which you’ll find in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">huglife/</code> directory.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Occupant</code> is a general class for all possible things that can inhabit the grid of the HugLife universe. You’ll see that every <code class="highlighter-rouge">Occupant</code> inherits a name, shared by all instances of that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Occupant</code> subtype. Furthermore, every <code class="highlighter-rouge">Occupant</code> must provide a method that returns a color (more on this later). There are two special <code class="highlighter-rouge">Occupant</code> types, with names “empty” and “impassible”. These represent unoccupied and unoccupiable squares, respectively.</li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Creature</code> is a general class for all living things that can inhabit the grid of the HugLife universe. Every <code class="highlighter-rouge">Creature</code> has an energy level, and if that energy level ever falls below zero, the universe will choose the DIE action for them.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Every creature must implement four callback methods: <code class="highlighter-rouge">move()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">replicate()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">attack()</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">stay()</code>. These describe what the creature should do when each of these actions occurs. There is no <code class="highlighter-rouge">die()</code> method since the creature is simply removed from the world entirely.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Creatures must also implement a <code class="highlighter-rouge">chooseAction()</code> method, and any reasonable creature will probably find the built-in <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNeighborsOfType()</code> method useful for doing so.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleCreature</code> is a sample <code class="highlighter-rouge">Creature</code>; in fact, it’s the lonely red square we saw earlier. The two creatures you implement for this lab will look somewhat similar to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleCreature</code>, so you’ll want to consult this class later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make some changes to the sample creature and observe how they affect the HugLife simulation. As one of your experiments, you might have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleCreature</code> react in some observable way when it sees a wall. You can do this by requesting a list of all neighbors of type “impassible” from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNeighborsOfType()</code> method.</p>

<!--
The commands to run the simulator are the same as above:

    $ javac -g huglife/*.java creatures/*.java
    $ java huglife.HugLife samplesolo
-->

<p>Hint: After you’re done experimenting, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git checkout</code> to revert your lab directory to its original state. Consult the documentation for Git if you don’t know how.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-plip">Creating a Plip</h2>

<p>Now it’s time to add a new type of creature to the world. Go into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">creatures/</code> directory, and you’ll see a file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip.java</code> there, waiting to be filled out.</p>

<h4 id="basic-plip-functionality">Basic Plip functionality</h4>

<p>Plips will be lazy (but motile) photosynthesizing creatures. They mostly just stand around and grow and replicate, but they’ll flee if they happen to see their mortal enemy, the Clorus.</p>

<p>Let’s start with just a few of the properties that we’ll eventually need for our Plip class.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">name()</code> method (inherited from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Occupant</code>) should return exactly “plip” with no spaces or capitalization. This is important, since creatures only know how to react to each other based on this name string. (Do you actually have to change anything to ensure this?)</li>
  <li>Plips should lose 0.15 units of energy on a MOVE action, and gain 0.2 units of energy on a STAY action.</li>
  <li>Plips should never have energy greater than 2. If an action would cause the Plip to have energy greater than 2, then it should be set to 2 instead.</li>
  <li>The color method for Plips should return a color with red = 99, blue = 76, and green that varies linearly based on the energy of the Plip. If the plip has zero energy, it should have a green value of 63. If it has max energy, it should have a green value of 255. The green value should vary with energy linearly in between these two extremes.</li>
</ul>

<p>We could test our <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip</code> class by sticking a bunch of Plips on a HugLife world grid and watching what they do as they run amok. However, it would be hard to determine whether everything was working correctly. Instead, let’s perform testing on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip</code> class directly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note on testing: It’s not necessarily desirable to test everything! Use 
tests only when you think they might reveal something useful, i.e. there is 
some chance you’ll get something wrong. Figuring out what to test is a bit 
of an art!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestPlip.java</code>, which is also in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">creatures/</code> directory. You’ll see that we’ve provided a test file <code class="highlighter-rouge">creatures.TestPlip</code> that you can run to test your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip</code> class.</p>

<p>Try it out and you’ll see that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testBasics</code> test fails.</p>

<p>Now modify the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip</code> class according to the specifications above until all tests pass. When you’re done, you’ll be well on your way to having a fully functional Plip!</p>

<h4 id="the-plip-replicate-method">The Plip replicate method</h4>

<p>Now we’ll work on adding the correct replication property to our Plips, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When a Plip replicates, it keeps 50% of its energy. The other 50% goes to its offspring. No energy is lost in the replication process.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll be filling out the <code class="highlighter-rouge">replicate()</code> method in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip.java</code>. Take a look at that now.</p>

<p>Before your start, write an appropriate test in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testReplicate()</code> method. Be sure to check that the returned <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip</code> is not the same <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip</code> as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip</code> whose <code class="highlighter-rouge">replicate()</code> method was called. You can use the JUnit <code class="highlighter-rouge">assertNotSame()</code> method for this purpose. (Do not confuse <code class="highlighter-rouge">assertNotEquals()</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">assertNotSame()</code>. See the JUnit documentation if the distinction is unclear!)</p>

<h4 id="the-plip-chooseaction-method">The Plip <code class="highlighter-rouge">chooseAction()</code> method</h4>

<p>All that’s left is giving the Plip a brain. To do this, you’ll be filling out the <code class="highlighter-rouge">chooseAction()</code> method.</p>

<p>The Plip should obey the following behavioral rules, in order of preference:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If there are no empty spaces, the Plip should STAY.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if the Plip has energy greater than 1.0, it should replicate to an available space.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if it sees a neighbor with <code class="highlighter-rouge">name()</code> equal to “clorus”, it will move to any available empty square with probability 50%. It should choose the empty square randomly. As an example, if it sees a Clorus to the LEFT and to the BOTTOM, and “empty” to the TOP and RIGHT, there is a 50% chance it will move (due to fear of Cloruses), and if it does move, it will pick randomly between RIGHT and TOP.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, it will stay.</li>
</ol>

<p>These rules must be obeyed in this strict order! Example: If it has energy greater than 1, it will always replicate, even if there are neighboring Cloruses.</p>

<h4 id="writing-tests-for-chooseaction">Writing tests for <code class="highlighter-rouge">chooseAction()</code></h4>
<p>Before you start on <code class="highlighter-rouge">chooseAction()</code>, uncomment the <code class="highlighter-rouge">@Test</code> annotation tag for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testChoose()</code> method in <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestPlip.java</code>. This will allow the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testChoose</code> test to run. The existing test checks the first rule, namely that if there are no empty spaces next to the Plip, then it should stay.</p>

<p>Add some more tests to <code class="highlighter-rouge">testChoose()</code>. You might find it useful to look at the code for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Action</code> class to see the various constructors for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Action</code>s.</p>

<p>Don’t worry (yet) about testing the 50% rule if a Clorus is nearby. This isn’t possible since you haven’t created a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Clorus</code> class yet, and thus you won’t be able to create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">HashMap</code> that involves Cloruses.</p>

<p>Later, once you write the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Clorus</code> class, you might find it interesting to come back and try to write a randomness test. One possibility is to simply test that both choices are possible by making many calls and ensuring that each happens at least once. Performing a statistical test is probably a bit too much for lab today (though you’re welcome to try).</p>

<h4 id="writing-chooseaction">Writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">chooseAction()</code></h4>

<p>After you’re happy with the tests you’ve written, edit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plip</code> class so that it makes the right choices. You’ll want to look carefully at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SampleCreature</code> class as a guide.</p>

<h2 id="simulating-plips">Simulating Plips</h2>

<p>Assuming your tests worked, you can now see how your Plips fare in the real HugLife world. Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">huglife.Huglife</code> with the command line argument <code class="highlighter-rouge">sampleplip</code>.</p>

<!--, or use the following commands from the command line:

    $ javac huglife/*.java creatures/*.java
    $ java huglife.HugLife sampleplip-->

<p>You should see your Plips happily growing along. If something goes wrong, it’s probably because your tests are not thorough enough. If this is the case, using the error messages, add new tests to <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestPlip.java</code> until something finally breaks.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-the-clorus">Introducing the Clorus</h2>

<p>Now we’ll implement the Clorus, a fierce blue-colored predator that enjoys nothing more than snacking on hapless Plips.</p>

<p>To begin, create <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestClorus.java</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Clorus.java</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">creatures</code> package. Unlike before, you’ll be writing these classes from scratch.</p>

<p>The Clorus should obey the following rules exactly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All Cloruses must have a name equal to exactly “clorus” (no capitalization or spaces).</li>
  <li>Cloruses should lose 0.03 units of energy on a MOVE action.</li>
  <li>Cloruses should lose 0.01 units of energy on a STAY action.</li>
  <li>Cloruses have no restrictions on their maximum energy.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">color()</code> method for Cloruses should always return the color red = 34, green = 0, blue = 231.</li>
  <li>If a Clorus attacks another creature, it should gain that creature’s energy. This should happen in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">attack()</code> method, not in <code class="highlighter-rouge">chooseAction()</code>. You do not need to worry about making sure the attacked creature dies—the simulator does that for you.</li>
  <li>When a Clorus replicates, it keeps 50% of its energy. The other 50% goes to its offspring. No energy is lost in the replication process.</li>
  <li>Cloruses should obey exactly the following behavioral rules:
    <ol>
      <li>If there are no empty squares, the Clorus will STAY (even if there are Plips nearby they could attack).</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if any Plips are seen, the Clorus will ATTACK one of them randomly.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the Clorus has energy greater than or equal to one, it will REPLICATE to a random empty square.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the Clorus will MOVE to a random empty square.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As before, write a <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestClorus</code> class first. You probably don’t need to test the <code class="highlighter-rouge">move()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">stay()</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">color()</code> methods, but you’re welcome to. You should include at least one test for each type of action.</p>

<p>Once you’re done writing tests, write the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Clorus</code> class itself.</p>

<p>After you’ve written and tested the class <i>thoroughly</i>, go into <code class="highlighter-rouge">HugLife.java</code> and uncomment the lines in <code class="highlighter-rouge">readWorld()</code>.</p>

<h2 id="showtime">Showtime</h2>

<p>We did it.</p>

<p>Now it’s time to watch Cloruses and Plips battling it out. Use the following command to kick off a Manichaean struggle that will end either in eternal oscillations or in lonely immortals wandering the wastes forever. Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">huglife.Huglife</code> with the command line argument <code class="highlighter-rouge">strugggz</code>.</p>

<!--, or use the following commands from the command line:

    $ javac huglife/*.java creatures/*.java
    $ java huglife.HugLife strugggz-->

<p>If you did everything right, it should hopefully look cool. You might consider tweaking the HugLife simulator parameters, including the world size and the pause time between simulation steps. Be warned that world sizes above 50x50 are probably going to run fairly slowly.</p>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>The autograder for this lab is very basic. If your HugLife simulation looks mostly right—that is, if it resembles the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/E2Kdowq.gifv">animation</a> from the introduction—you probably did everything correctly.</p>
