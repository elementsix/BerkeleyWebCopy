<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before You Begin</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you haven’t signed up to receive a GitHub repository, follow the
  instructions <a href="https://piazza.com/class/j9j0udrxjjp758?cid=59">here</a>.</li>
  <li>The vast majority of students use their own computer instead of the lab
  computers. If you want to use your own computer, complete
  <a href="../lab1setup/lab1setup-2.html">lab1setup</a> before beginning this lab.</li>
  <li>Since most students work on their own computers, your instructional account is not likely to be useful to you other than
  checking your grades. To see how to use your instructional account, see the
  <a href="../../guides/instructional-accounts.html">instructional accounts guide</a>.</li>
  <li>Be aware that there are a large number of setup steps this first week.
  <strong>Don’t be discouraged</strong>, and make sure to ask for help if you’re stuck! If
  you’re an on-campus student, the best place to ask for help is in the
  actual lab. If you’re not, Piazza is your best bet.</li>
  <li>Project 0 will allow pair-partnerships subject to <a href="../../guides/partnerships-2.html">these
  rules</a>. Lab might be a good place to meet a
  partner – but make sure you both have the same Java background and are
  willing to work together in the same room (see partnership rules for
  details)!</li>
  <li>
    <p class="redtext">For those of you who have been working ahead, do not use
  IntelliJ  (from lab 2) today. For today's lab, please work from the command
  line to compile and run your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Warning: This lab runs a little long, and it’s normal if you do not finish during your lab period, especially if you end up having a tricky setup issue that requires a lot of assistance.</li>
  <li>It’s OK to talk to other students while you work on this lab (or any other), but you should ultimately do all the typing/programming/entering-of-commands yourself. There’s a lot of important setup information in this lab that you need to have done independently of anyone else.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="find-a-partner">Find A Partner</h4>

<p>Introduce yourself to someone you don’t know who has the same OS to collaborate with you as you complete the setup steps for today’s lab. Try to find someone who has similar programming experience - you’re encouraged to partner up for project 0!</p>

<h2 id="a-java-compilation--development">A. Java Compilation &amp; Development</h2>
<p>Java 9 is currently installed on the instructional machines. You may need to
install it on your personal computer. You can find instructions to do this
above.</p>

<h4 id="introduction-to-java">Introduction to Java</h4>

<p>Complete exercises 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 from the <a href="https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap1/chap11.html">H61B
textbook</a>. Also consider reading Chapter 1.1 as a review of what you’ve already seen in lecture (either on video or in person). Note that the videos embedded in the textbook are just the lecture videos, so there’s no need to watch them again.</p>

<p>For this lab, you should use the command line,
not an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse (see lab 2). Don’t worry about submitting
your work yet, we’ll cover how to do that later in this lab.</p>

<h2 id="b-git--local-repos">B. Git &amp; Local Repos</h2>

<p>In 61B, you’ll be required to use the git version control tool, which is wildly
popular out in the real world. Unfortunately, the abstractions behind it are
fairly tricky to understand, so it is likely that you will encounter significant
frustration at some point as you learn to use git.</p>

<p>Before you proceed, read sections A-C of Sarah Kim’s <a href="../../guides/using-git-2.html">Using Git
Guide</a></p>

<div class="redtext">STOP! Do not proceed until you have read sections A
through C of the Using Git Guide.</div>
<p>You do not need to read section D or later.</p>

<h2 id="c-git-exercise">C. Git Exercise</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve read the first 3 sections of the Using Git Guide, you’re now ready to
start using git! As part of your lab checkoff, you will be working through a
small git workflow by setting up a git repository and making a couple commits
to the repository. An academic intern or TA will look at the git repository during
checkoff to ensure that it is in a good state. Please do the following actions.
If you’re stuck on a step at any point, don’t hesitate to ask a TA or an 
academic intern for help!</p>

<p>If you need help with creating directories, creating files, changing
directories, etc., see section B of <a href="../lab1setup/lab1setup-2.html">lab1setup</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a directory called lab1-checkoff. You can put this directory anywhere
 on your computer.</li>
  <li>Move into the lab1-checkoff directory, and initialize a git repository in
 this directory.</li>
  <li>Create a file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">61b.txt</code> in any way you’d like. In this .txt file, add
 the text “61b version 1” into it.</li>
  <li>Create another file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">61c.txt</code> in any way you’d like. In this .txt
 file, add the text “61c version 1” into it.</li>
  <li>Begin tracking only <code class="highlighter-rouge">61b.txt</code>, and create a new commit containing just this
 file, with the following commit message: “Add 61b.txt”.</li>
  <li>Make a modification in <code class="highlighter-rouge">61b.txt</code> by changing the text in the file to:
 “61b changed to version 2”.</li>
  <li>Make another commit, this time containing both <code class="highlighter-rouge">61b.txt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">61c.txt</code>. The
 commit message should be: “Update 61b.txt and add 61c.txt”.</li>
  <li>Finally, make one more modification to <code class="highlighter-rouge">61b.txt</code> by changing the text in the
 file to: “61b changed to version 3”. Don’t commit this version.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, if there are any questions for any of these steps, please ask in
lab or on Piazza.</p>

<p>At this point, if you were to type in <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code>, something close to this
should show:</p>

<p><img src="img/exercise-status.png" alt="Git Exercise Status" /></p>

<p>Also, if you were to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git log</code>, something close to this should show:</p>

<p><img src="img/exercise-log.png" alt="Git Exercise Log" /></p>

<p>Be sure to save this repository and directory until you get checked-off by an
academic intern or TA. See section E for more information on getting credit for
the lab checkoff. <strong>Along with other short conceptual questions involving
git, you will be asked to revert 61b.txt back to the version in the most recent
commit, as well as back to the earliest version of the file, so make sure
you know how to do this!</strong> Hint: Look into the <em>checkout</em> command.</p>

<p>Note: Be careful when using the <em>checkout</em> command, as your repo might end up
in an unexpected state. Specifically, if you see something about
your repository being in a detached HEAD state as a result of a checkout
command, that is something we don’t want. Read
<a href="../../guides/git-wtfs-2.html#head-detached-at--">here</a> for more on what it is
and how to fix it.</p>

<h2 id="d-git--remote-repos">D. Git &amp; Remote Repos</h2>

<p>We’re now ready to finish off the lab. But first…</p>

<p class="redtext">STOP! Before you proceed, read section D of the Using Git Guide</p>
<p><a href="../../guides/using-git-2.html">Here</a> is the link to the guide. There is no need
to read sections E or later. Those are for your later reference, and do not
need to be read during this lab.</p>

<p>In 61B, you’ll be required to submit your code to your personal GitHub
repository. This is for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To spare you the incredible agony of losing your files.</li>
  <li>To submit your work for grading and to get results back from the autograder.</li>
  <li>To save you from the tremendous anguish of making unknown changes to your
  files that break everything.</li>
  <li>To ensure that we have easy access to your code so that we can help if you’re
  stuck.</li>
  <li><strong>To dissuade you from posting your solutions on the web in a public GitHub
  repository</strong>. This is a major violation of course policy!</li>
  <li>To expose you to a realistic workflow that is common on every major project
  you’ll ever work on again.</li>
  <li>To enable safer, more equitable partner collaborations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before beginning this section ensure that the name of your GitHub repository in
the <a href="https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B-Student">Berkeley-CS61B-Student
organization</a> matches
your instructional account login. If this is not true, please let your TA know.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You’ll need to perform this series of steps to set up your Git repo
on each computer you use (e.g. instructional computer, personal computer). If
you know that you’ll only be using your personal computer, feel free to do this
only on your personal computer (and not your lab account).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Clone your <a href="https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B-Student">Berkeley-CS61B-Student
organization</a> repository.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to the spot in your folders on your computer that you’d like to
 start your repository. In the example below, I’m assuming you want all your stuff in a folder named cs61b, but you can pick a different name if you’d like.
        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>cs61b
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the following command to clone your GitHub repo. Make sure to
 replace the <code class="highlighter-rouge">**</code> with your own instructional account login/repo name.
        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> git clone https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B-Student/sp18-<span class="k">**</span>.git
</code></pre></div>        </div>
        <p>If you’d like to SSH instead of HTTPS (and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">set up your own SSH
 key</a>), feel free
 to also do that instead. If you don’t know what any of this means, just use the command above. The advantage of SSH is that you won’t have to type in
 your GitHub password every time you use your repository.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Move into your newly created repo! (Make sure you do this part, or the
 rest of the steps below will not work correctly.)
        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>sp18-<span class="k">**</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the <code class="highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code> remote repository. You will pull from this remote
repository to get starter code for assignments. (Make sure that you are
within the newly created repository folder when the continue with these
commands.)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the following command to add the <code class="highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code> remote.
        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> git remote add skeleton https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp18.git
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Listing the remotes should now show both the <code class="highlighter-rouge">origin</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code>
 remotes.
        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> $ git remote -v
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>If you get an error that says “Not a git repository”, make sure you’re in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sp18-**</code> directory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="working-on-the-skeleton">Working on the Skeleton</h4>

<ol>
  <li>You must now pull from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code> remote in order to get the starter code
for lab 1. You will also do this when new projects and assignments are
released. To do this, use the spookiest command in the whole git toolbox:
    <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span>git pull skeleton master
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>What this does is grab all remote files from the repo named <code class="highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code>
 (which is located at <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp18.git</code>)
 and copies them into your current folder.</p>

    <p>If you get an error similar to “fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories”, you probably ran
 GitHub’s suggested commands when you created your repository. To fix this, you can instead run:</p>
    <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span>git pull <span class="nt">--rebase</span> <span class="nt">--allow-unrelated-histories</span> skeleton master
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>this time only.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you list the files in your current directory, you’ll see that there are now two folders: <code class="highlighter-rouge">lab1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">library-sp18</code>. Look in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">library-sp18</code> folder, and you’ll see that it is currently empty and will receive some sweet stuff in the lab2 setup. Don’t delete it. Look in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lab1</code> folder and you’ll see files called <code class="highlighter-rouge">LeapYear.java</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">magic_word.txt</code> that you’ll work with in later parts of this lab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Move the <code class="highlighter-rouge">HelloWorld.java</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">HelloNumbers.java</code> that you previously
created into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lab1</code> directory. If you didn’t create <code class="highlighter-rouge">HelloNumbers.java</code>,
go back and do Exercise 1.1.2 (see part A of this lab).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Stage and commit <code class="highlighter-rouge">HelloWorld.java</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">HelloNumbers.java</code>.
    <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span>git add lab1/<span class="k">*</span>
 <span class="nv">$ </span>git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"completed first part of lab1"</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Push these changes to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">origin</code> remote repo.
    <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span>git push origin master
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>You can verify that this has been successful by checking your repo on
 <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. For example, if your repo were <code class="highlighter-rouge">sp18-alf</code>, you’d go to <a href="https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B-Student/sp18-alf">https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B-Student/sp18-alf</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="e-git-checkoff">E. Git Checkoff</h2>

<p>Once you’ve verified that your code was pushed to github, put your name down on the lab whiteboard to get your git exercise (from part C) checked off. The TA or lab
assistant, upon completion of the lab checkoff, will tell you what to put into the magic word file in order to pass the autograder. If there’s a wait, feel free to move on to part F until your name is called.</p>

<h2 id="f-leap-year">F. Leap Year</h2>

<p>In the lab1 folder, you should see a file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">LeapYear.java</code>. This program is supposed to test whether or not a given year is a Leap Year. The user will
give a year as a command line parameter (examples given below), and then print out whether or not that year is a leap year, e.g.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ java LeapYear 2000
2000 is a leap year.
$ java LeapYear 1999
1999 is not a leap year.
$ java LeapYear 2004
2004 is a leap year.
$ java LeapYear 2100
2100 is not a leap year.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A leap year is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>divisible by 400 or</li>
  <li>divisible by 4 and not by 100.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, 2000 and 2004 are leap years. 1900, 2003, and 2100 are not leap years.</p>

<p>Your code must declare a method as follows: <code class="highlighter-rouge">public static boolean
isLeapYear(int year)</code>. This method will be tested by the Gradescope autograder. Make sure to provide a description of the method as a comment. Your description should be contained by <code class="highlighter-rouge">/**</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">*/</code>. Comments contained by <code class="highlighter-rouge">/**</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">*/</code> are also called “Javadoc comments” or just “Javadocs”. These comments can span multiple lines if need the extra space, e.g. the <code class="highlighter-rouge">checkLeapYear</code> Javadocs.</p>

<p>Javdocs may contain optional tags, e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">@param</code>. We do not require you to use any tags like this in 61B except the <code class="highlighter-rouge">@source</code> tag. Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">@source</code> tag any time you receive significant help on a project. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">@source</code> tag is not required for HW or lab, though we recommend it anyway, since it’s a good scholarly and professional habit to cite your sources.</p>

<p>Some Java tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">%</code> operator implements remainder. Thus, the value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">year % 4</code> will be
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">!=</code> operator compares two values for inequality. The code fragment <code class="highlighter-rouge">if
 (year % 4 != 0)</code> reads as “if the remainder when dividing year by 4 is not
 equal to 0.”</li>
  <li>When one of the arguments of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> operator is a String, the arguments are
 concatenated as Strings. For example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">"horse"</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">"babies"</code> would return
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">"horsebabies"</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="g-submitting-lab-1">G. Submitting Lab 1</h2>

<p>The last step is to submit your work with Gradescope. Gradescope is the site that you’ll use to
submit homework, lab, and project assignments. To sign up for Gradescope,
head to <a href="http://gradescope.com/">gradescope.com</a> and click on the “Sign up for
free” link at the top right. Use the entry code posted in this <a href="https://piazza.com/class/j9j0udrxjjp758?cid=51">Piazza
thread</a>. If you’re already registered somehow (e.g. a TA added you), there’s no need to enter the code again.</p>

<p>To submit your code, do NOT use the Drag and Drop feature. Instead, click the
little GitHub button in the bottom right (shown below).</p>

<p><img src="img/github_button.png" alt="Github Button" /></p>

<p>After clicking this button, you’ll be taken to a screen where you select your
repository and branch (shown below). If your login is “sp18-ape”, you’ll select
“sp18-ape” in the top box, and in the bottom box you’ll pick “master”.
Later, you can create your own “branches” (as described in the advanced part of the Git Guide) if you want those graded instead,
though that won’t be required in 61B.</p>

<p><img src="img/github_repo_and_branch_selection.png" alt="Github Repo and Branch Selection" /></p>

<p>Please report any issues you may have to Piazza. Entire error messages
and/or screenshots are welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Important: ** We HIGHLY encourage you to make frequent commits! **Lack of
proper version control will not be considered an excuse for lost work,
particularly after the first few weeks.</strong></p>
