    </div>

    <div class="content">
    <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this lab is to acquaint you with the structure and 
        workings of the virtual memory system. You will work with two different 
        simulators to develop this understanding.</p>
    <h2>Info</h2>
        <p>For this lab you will be mostly using the virtual memory simulation
        features of Camera, a cache and virtual memory simulator. You may also
        find the cache simulations interesting, however we won't be working
        with those here.  Unfortunately, Camera is known to have issues when
        trying to run it on the instructional machines, so it's recommand to
        download Camera from <a href="Camera.jar">here</a>, and simply double
        click on the jar file to run it on your own laptop. If you're on a mac,
        you may need to go to "Security & Privacy" in your settings and click
        "open anyway" to allow Camera to run. Some displays don't seem to play
        nice with the standard Camera app, if the values in memory are all
        squished together, try running this version of
        <a href="CameraHDPI.jar">Camera</a>.</p>

        <p>Once Camera opens up, select the virtual memory option to open a
        visualization of the virtual memory system. In the top left you can see
        the contents of physical memory. Just below that is a listing of all
        the pages of virtual memory for this process. To the right of these
        items are the contents of the TLB and the Page Table. At this point
        these should all be empty as we haven't done anything yet. Read about
        the statistics of your memory system in the &quot;PROGRESS UPDATE&quot;
        box at the bottom of the window. This area will keep you updated on
        your status through the simulation as it progresses. You can move the
        simulation forward, backward or start it over from the beginning using
        the buttons to the right of the &quot;PROGRESS UPDATE&quot; box.</p>


    <h2>Exercises</h2>
    <h3>Exercise 1: A Sample Run (CAMERA)</h3>
        <p>Click the button labeled &quot;Auto Generate Add. Ref. Str.&quot; at
        the right-hand side of the window. This will generate a set of ten
        address references. You can think of these as a series of RISC-V
        &quot;load word&quot; instructions reading from the memory address
        specified. Click the button labeled &quot;Next&quot; to begin the
        simulation.</p> <p>For the rest of this exercise you are at the mercy
        of the &quot;PROGRESS UPDATE&quot; box. After each click of the
        &quot;Next&quot; button examine the contents of the box and the current
        state of the memory system. Try to really get an understanding of what
        is going on in the TLB, the Page Table, and Physical Memory at each
        step.</p> <p>Once you have reached the end of the simulation note the
        number of TLB Hits and Misses and Page Hits and Faults. Write these
        numbers down, along with the sequence of memory accesses used to show
        to your TA during checkoff.</p>

      <div class="checkoff">
        <h4>Checkoff </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Show your TA the number of TLB Hits and Misses and Page Hits and Faults, 
              along with the sequence of memory accesses used. Did you have any Page 
              Hits? Why or why not? Be ready to describe the steps on a memory 
              request.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <h3>Exercise 2: MISS! (CAMERA)</h3>
        <p>Now that you've seen what a random workload looks like in the VM system 
        let's try creating a custom workload with a specific property. Your goal 
        for this exercise is to create a workload of ten memory accesses that 
        will cause ten TLB misses and ten Page Faults. You should be able to 
        come up with such a workload on paper, but then you should run it in 
        CAMERA to verify your work. You can specify a custom workload in CAMERA 
        by clicking the button labeled &quot;Self Generate Add. Ref. Str.&quot; and 
        entering in the addresses you want to reference one at a time. When you 
        are satisfied that you've got a valid sequence write it down and be 
        ready to show it to your TA during checkoff.</p>

      <div class="checkoff">
         <h4>Checkoff</h4>
         <ul>
          <li>Show your TA a workload of ten memory accesses that will cause ten TLB 
              misses and ten Page Faults.</li>
         </ul>
       </div>

    <h3>Exercise 3: Memory Systems Engineering (CAMERA)</h3>
        <p>Given your sequence of memory accesses from Exercises 2, can you find a 
        change to a single parameter (e.g. TLB size, page table size, memory 
        size, etc...) that would result in the same number (ten) of TLB misses 
        but result in fewer than ten page faults? Work through this on paper and 
        be ready to show your results to your TA during checkoff.</p>

    <div class="checkoff">
        <h4>Checkoff</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Explain the single parameter change that would result in ten TLB misses, 
              but fewer than ten page faults.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <h3>Exercise 4: Putting it all in Context (VMSIM)</h3>
        <p>VMSIM is another online virtual memory simulator. You have three options for this exercise.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Go to the VMSIM <a href="http://denninginstitute.com/workbenches/vmsim/vm.html">website</a> and inspect the VMSIM applet. On this site you can run the simulation, step through it, and reset it. However, this application may not run correctly on Chrome, so if you are running it on your home machine or on hive you should use Firefox. You may also run into security settings with Java. More about java security permissions can be found <a href="https://java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml">here</a> </li>
          <li>If you are unable to open the link in your browser, you may also use the <tt>appletviewer</tt> command in terminal like so: <pre class="output">$ <span class="input">appletviewer http://denninginstitute.com/workbenches/vmsim/vm.html</span> </pre></li>
          <li> Watch this <a href="vm.webm">webm</a> of the simulation, and answer the questions using it.</li>
        </ul>




           <!--  a href=""></a> You can find VMSIM 
        <a href="http://denninginstitute.com/workbenches/vmsim/vm.html">here</a>.
        If you are unable to open the link in your browser, you may also use the <tt>appletviewer</tt> command in terminal like so:
        <pre class="output">$ <span class="input">appletviewer http://denninginstitute.com/workbenches/vmsim/vm.html</span> </pre></p>
        <p><i>You might not be able to run this exercise on your own machine due to permission problems. To edit your java security permissions. Instructions can be found <a href="https://java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml">here</a> </i></p> -->
        <p>What is different about the setup of the system in VMSIM as
        compared to CAMERA? In particular, what are P1, P2, P3, and P4? If you watch closely
        you'll see that this simulation reports a much higher percentage of TLB misses than the
        random run on CAMERA did. Why might this be? (If you have trouble following the
        simulation, you can turn down the speed using the slider on the bottom right.)</p>
    

      <div class="checkoff">
        <h4>Checkoff</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Explain why there is a much higher percentage of TLB misses in this 
              simulation.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    </div>
