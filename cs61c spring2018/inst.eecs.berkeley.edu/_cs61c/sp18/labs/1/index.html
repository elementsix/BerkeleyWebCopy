                HEY! WELCOME TO LAB 1 OF CS61C. IT'S LAB 1 BUT IT'S THE SECOND
                LAB. THAT'S ZERO-BASED INDEXING.
            </p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>

            </ul>    
            <p>
                <b class="update">BEFORE YOU ASK FOR CHECKOFF:</b>
                Have the following open and ready to show to the TA or lab
                assistant. Doing this before asking for a checkoff will speed
                up the checkoff process.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The file <code>eccentric.c</code></li>
                <li>
                    Your answers to the questions regarding GDB commands
                    (Exercise 2)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The output from running the <code>ll_equal</code> program
                </li>
                <li>The file <code>ll_cycle.c</code></li>
                <li>
                    The output from running the <code>ll_cycle</code> program
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>
                Copy the contents of <code>~cs61c/labs/01</code> to a suitable
                location in your home directory. These are all the files you'll
                need to complete this lab. Below is an example of how to do so.
                Lab files will <b>always</b> be located in
                <code>~cs61c/labs</code>.
            </p>

            <pre class='output'>
$ <span class='input'>mkdir labs      # only run this if you don't have the 'labs' directory</span>
$ <span class='input'>cp -r ~cs61c/labs/01/ ~/labs</span></pre>
            <p>
                Note: <code>cp</code> means "copy" and the <code>-r</code> flag
                is for copying folders (<i>recursively</i>)
            </p>

            <h2>Compiling and Running a C Program</h2>
                <p>In this lab, we will be using the command line program
                <code>gcc</code> to compile programs in C. The simplest way to
                run <code>gcc</code> is as follows:
            </p>
            <pre class="output">$ <span class="input">gcc program.c</span></pre>
            <p>
                This compiles <code>program.c</code> into an executable file 
                named <code>a.out</code>. If you've taken CS61B or have
                experience with Java, you can kinda think of <code>gcc</code> as
                the C equivalent of <code>javac</code>. This file can be run
                with the following command:
            </p>
            <pre class="output">$ <span class="input">./a.out</span></pre>
            <p>
                The executable file is <code>a.out</code>, so what the heck is
                the <code>./</code>? Answer: when you want to execute an
                executable, you need to prepend a filepath in order to
                distinguish your command from a command like
                <code>python3</code>. The dot refers to the "current directory."
                Incidentally, double dots (<code>..</code>) would refer to the
                directory one level up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>gcc</code> has various command line options which you are
                encouraged to explore. In this lab, however, we will only be
                using <code>-o</code>, which is used to specify the name of the
                executable file that <code>gcc</code> creates. Using 
                <code>-o</code>, you would use the following commands to compile
                <code>program.c</code> into a program named <code>program</code>,
                and then run it. This is helpful if you don't want all of your
                executable files to be named <code>a.out</code>.
            </p>
            <pre class="output">
$ <span class="input">gcc -o program program.c</span>
$ <span class="input">./program</span></pre>

            <h3>Exercise 1: Simple C Program</h3>
            <p>
                In this exercise, we will see an example of preprocessor macro
                definitions. Macros can be a messy topic, but in general the
                way they work is that before a C file is compiled, all macro
                constant names are replaced exactly with the value they refer
                to.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the scope of this exercise, we will be using macro
                definitions exclusively as global constants. Here we define
                <code>CONSTANT_NAME</code> to refer to <code>literal_value</code>
                (an integer literal). Note that there is only a space
                separating name from value.
            </p>
            <pre>#define CONSTANT_NAME literal_value</pre>
            <p>
                Now, look at the code contained in 
                <a href='eccentric.c' target='_blank'>eccentric.c</a>.
                <b>Notice</b> the four different examples of basic C control
                flow. (What are they?) Also, do you recognize these 
                <i>eccentric</i> sayings and people from Berkeley?
            </p>
            <p>
                First compile and run the program to see what it does. Play
                around with the constant values of the four macros:
                <code>V0</code> through <code>V3</code>. See how changing
                <b>each</b> of them changes the program output.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your task: Modifying only these four values, make the program
                produce the following output.
            </p>
            <pre class="output">
$ <span class="input">gcc -o eccentric eccentric.c</span>
$ <span class="input">./eccentric</span>

            <p>
                There are actually several different combinations of macros
                that can give this output. Here's the challenge for you in this
                exercise: consider what the minimum number of <b>distinct</b>
                values that <code>V0</code> through <code>V3</code> can have
                such that they still give this exact output. For example, the
                theoretical maximum is four, when they are all distinct from
                each other.

            <h3>Exercise 2: Debugger</h3>
            <p><b>What is a debugger?</b></p>
            <p>
                This section is intended for students who aren't familiar with
                what debuggers are. A <b>debugger</b>, as the name suggests,
                is a program which is designed specifically to help you find
                bugs, or logical errors and mistakes in your code (side note:
                if you want to know why errors are called bugs, look
                <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-errors-in-software-codes-called-bugs" target="_blank">here</a>).
                Different debuggers have different features, but it is common
                for all debuggers to be able to do the following things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Set a <b>breakpoint</b> in your program. A breakpoint
                    is a specific line in your code where you would like to
                    <b>stop</b> execution of the program so you can take a
                    look at what's going on nearby.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Step line-by-line</b> through the program. Code only
                    ever executes line by line, but it happens too quickly
                    for us to figure out which lines cause mistakes. Being
                    able to step line-by-line through your code allows you
                    to hone in on <b>exactly</b> what is causing a bug in
                    your program.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                For this exercise, you will find the
                <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/resources/gdb5-refcard.pdf" target="_blank">GDB reference card</a>
                useful. GDB stands for "GNU De-Bugger." Compile
                <a href="hello.c" target="_blank"><code>hello.c</code></a> with
                the "-g" flag:
            </p>
            <pre class='output'>
$ <span class='input'>gcc -g -o hello hello.c</span></pre>
            <p>
                This causes gcc to store information in the executable program
                for gdb to make sense of it. Now start the debugger, (c)gdb:
            </p>
<pre class='output'>$ <span class='input'>cgdb hello</span></pre>
            <p>
                Notice what this command does! You are running the program
                <code>cgdb</code> on the <b>executable</b> file
                <code>hello</code> generated by <code>gcc</code>. Don't try
                running cgdb on the source code in <code>hello.c</code>! It
                won't know what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                If cgdb does not work, you can also use gdb to complete the
                following exercises (start gdb with <code>gdb hello</code>).
                The cgdb debugger is only installed on your cs61c-xxx accounts.
                Please use the hive machines or one of the computers in 27x Soda
                to run cgdb, since our version of cgdb was built for Ubuntu.
            </p>
            <p><b>Task: step through the whole program by:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>setting a breakpoint at main</li>
                <li>using gdb's run command</li>
                <li>using gdb's single-step command</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Type <code>help</code> from within gdb to find out the commands
                to do these things, or use the reference card.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Look here if you see an error message like</b>
                <code>printf.c: No such file or directory.</code> You probably
                <i>stepped</i> into a <code>printf</code> function! If you keep
                stepping, you'll feel like you're going nowhere! CGDB is
                complaining because you don't have the actual file where
                <code>printf</code> is defined. This is pretty annoying. To free
                yourself from this black hole, use the command
                <code>finish</code> to run the program until the current frame
                returns (in this case, until printf is finished). And
                <b>NEXT</b> time, use <code>next</code> to skip over the line
                which used <code>printf</code>.
            </p>
            <p><b>Note: cgdb vs gdb</b></p>
            <p>
                In this exercise, we use cgdb to debug our programs. cgdb is
                identical to gdb, except it provides some extra nice features
                that make it more pleasant to use in practice. All of the
                commands on the reference sheet work in gdb.
            </p>
            <p>
                In cgdb, you can press <code>ESC</code> to go to the code window
                (top) and <code>i</code> to return to the command window
                (bottom) &mdash; similar to <code>vim</code>. The bottom command
                window is where you'll enter your gdb commands.
            </p>
            <p><b>Task: Learn MORE gdb commands</b></p>
            <p>
                Learning these commands will prove useful for the rest of this
                lab, and your C programming career in general. Create a text
                file containing answers to the following questions (or write
                them down on a piece of paper, or just memorize them if you
                think you want to become a GDB pro).
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    How do you <b>pass command line arguments</b> to a
                    program when using gdb?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How do you <b>set a breakpoint</b> which only occurs
                    when a <b>set of conditions is true</b> (e.g. when
                    certain variables are a certain value)?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How do you <b>execute the next line of C code</b> in

                </li>
                <li>
                    If the next line of code is a function call, you'll
                    execute the whole function call at once if you use
                    your answer to #3. (If not, consider a different
                    command for #3!) How do you tell GDB that you <b>want
                    to debug the code inside the function</b> instead? (If
                    you changed your answer to #3, then that answer is most
                    likely now applicable here.)

            <p>
                You will now use your newly acquired gdb knowledge to debug a
                short C program! Consider the program
                <a href="ll_equal.c" target="_blank"><code>ll_equal.c</code></a>.
                Compile and run the program, and experiment with it. By
                default, it will give you the following result:
            </p>
            <pre class='output'>
$ <span class='input'>gcc -g -o ll_equal ll_equal.c</span>
$ <span class='input'>./ll_equal</span>
equal test 1 result = 1
Segmentation fault</pre>

            <p><b>Figure out what's causing that segmentation fault!</b></p>
            <p>
                Start gdb on the program, following the instructions for
                compilation in exercise 1. We recommend setting a breakpoint in
                the <code>ll_equal()</code> function. When the debugger stops at
                the breakpoint, try stepping through the program to see if you
                can figure out what's causing the error.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hint 1: run <code>bt</code> after the program crashes in gdb. It will output the program trace. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Hint 2: pay attention to the values of the pointers
                <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the function (print them!).
                Are they always pointed to the right address?
            </p>
            <p>
                Hint 3: Look at the source code in <code>main</code> to see the
                structure of the nodes and what exactly is being passed into
                <code>ll_equal</code>.
            </p>

            <div class='checkoff'>
                <h4>Checkoff</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Explain the bug and your fix to the function.</li>

            </div>

            <h3>
                Exercise 4: "Debugging" a C program that requires user input
            </h3>
            <p>
                Let's see what happens if your program requires user input and
                you try to run GDB on it. First, run the program defined by
                <a href="interactive_hello.c" target="_blank"><code>interactive_hello.c</code></a>
                to talk to an overly friendly program.
            </p>
            <pre class='output'>
$ <span class='input'>gcc -g -o int_hello interactive_hello.c</span>
$ <span class='input'>./int_hello</span></pre>
            <p>
                Now, we're going to try to debug it (even though there really
                are no bugs).
            </p>
            <pre class='output'>
$ <span class='input'>cgdb int_hello</span></pre>
            <p>
                What happens when you try to run the program to completion?
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll be learning about a tool to help us avoid this situation.
                The purpose of this exercise is to make you unafraid of running
                the debugger even when your program needs user input.
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out that you can send text to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_.28stdin.29" target="_blank">stdin</a>,
                the file stream read by the function <code>fgets</code> in this
                silly program, with some special characters right from the
                command line. Take a look at "redirection" on
                <a href="https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/c/file-io/intro" target="_blank">this website</a>,
                and see if you can figure out how to send some input to the
                program without explicitly providing it while it's running
                (which, I hope you've realized, gets you stuck in CGDB).
            </p>
            <p>
                Look at
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19467865/how-to-use-redirection-in-c-for-file-input" target="_blank">this stackoverflow post</a>
                for more inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hint 1: If you're creating a text file containing your input,
                you're on the right track!
            </p>
            <p>
                Hint 2: Remember you can run things with <b>command line
                args (<i>including the redirection symbols</i>) from CGDB</b>
                as well!
            </p>

            <div class='checkoff'>
                <h4>Checkoff</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Demonstrate how you run CGDB to completion on the
                        executable created by compiling
                        <code>interactive_hello.c</code> without getting stuck.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                Hopefully you appreciate how redirection helped you avoid that
                nasty situation with CGDB. Don't ever be afraid of the debugger!
                We know it looks kind of nasty, but it's there to help you.
            </p>

            <h3>Exercise 5: Pointers and Structures in C</h3>
            <p>
                Here's one to help you in your interviews. In
                <a href="ll_cycle.c" target="_blank"><code>ll_cycle.c</code></a>,
                complete the function <code>ll_has_cycle()</code> to implement
                the following algorithm for checking if a singly-linked list
                has a cycle.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Start with two pointers at the head of the list. We'll
                    call the first one <code>tortoise</code> and the second
                    one <code>hare</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Advance <code>hare</code> by two nodes. If this is not
                    possible because of a null pointer, we have found the
                    end of the list, and therefore the list is acyclic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Advance <code>tortoise</code> by one node. (A null
                    pointer check is unnecessary. <i>Why?</i>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    If tortoise and hare point to the same node, the list
                    is cyclic. Otherwise, go back to step 2.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                After you have correctly implemented <code>ll_has_cycle()</code>,
                the program you get when you compile <code>ll_cycle.c</code>
                will tell you that <code>ll_has_cycle()</code> agrees with
                what the program expected it to output.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hint: There are two common ways that students usually write
                this function. They differ in how they choose to encode the 
                stopping criteria. If you do it one way, you'll have to account
                for a special case in the beginning. If you do it another way, 
                you'll have some extra NULL checks, which is OK. The previous 2
                sentences are meant to urge you to not stress over cleanliness.
                If they don't help you, just ignore them. The point of this
                exercise is to make sure you know how to use pointers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd.27s_Tortoise_and_Hare" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a>
                on the algorithm and why it works. Don't worry about it if you
                don't completely understand it. We won't test you on this.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>By the way</b>, the pointers are called "tortoise" and
                "hare" because the tortoise pointer is incremented slowly (like
                a tortoise, which moves slowly) and the hare pointer is
                incremented quickly (twice as fast as the tortoise; like a hare,
                which moves quickly).
            </p>
            <p>
                As a closing note, the story of the
                <a href="http://read.gov/aesop/025.html" target="_blank">tortoise and the hare</a>
                is always relevant, especially in CS61C. Writing your C
                programs slowly and steadily, using debugging programs like
                CGDB, is what will win you the race.
