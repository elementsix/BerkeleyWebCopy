    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Reasoning about large, complex, and distributed applications can be very
    challenging. In single node applications, we deal with complexity through
    libraries and functions. However, these are still all linked together at
    compile time and can't change while the application is running. To help
    manage this complexity, and to allow different teams to develop their
    modules independently, many companies organize their applications around
    microservices.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">Microservices</a> are
    small programs with a well-defined (and usually network-based) interface
    that rarely changes. If we need more scale, we simply run more copies of
    the program on different nodes. If there is a new feature or bug fix, we
    can roll it out slowly by replacing only a few of the copies at a time.
    Finally, this type of deployment can be tolerant of faults since each
    service is only responsible for a limited part of the whole application,
    and there are usually many copies of each service to chose from if
    something goes wrong.</p>

    <p>Microservices are a form of concurrency. In this context, concurrency
    refers to doing many <i>different</i> tasks at the same time. One task
    could be handling client requests, while the other provides a database, and
    another logs performance data. This is slightly different than the sort of
    parallelism you've seen so far in this class (such as Spark or OpenMP)
    because those frameworks execute the same basic task across many nodes (for
    example, many mappers running the same map function). The inventer of the
    Go programming language has a pretty good talk on this difference and why
    it matters in Go <a
    href="https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>In this project, you will be designing a memoization service.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">Memoization</a> is an
    optimization technique where you try to remember the outcome of some
    expensive computation so that you don't have to run it again if you see the
    same input again. In this example, we will be memoizing the result of a
    machine-learning model. Clients will send your service a request to
    classify an image (hand-written digits in this case), if you've never seen
    the image before, you can ask the machine-learning microservice to classify
    it, but ML models can be expensive and slow to run. To speed things up,
    your service will need to save the classification of that image in a
    caching service. The next time the same image is requested, you can answer
    from the cache instead of the ML model, improving average performance by
    quite a bit. Together, the whole application will look something like this:</p>
    <img src="overview.png" style="width: 40%;" class="center"/>

    <h3>Go</h3>
    <p>You will be using the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go programming
      language</a> for this project. Go is a good choice for this sort of thing
    for a number of reasons. Firstly, Go was designed from the ground up to
    support concurrency.
    Second, Go has very robust and easy-to-use testing tools. You should expect
    to write at least as many lines of unit tests as you do application code.
    Finally, Go is a fairly new language that tries to find
    a happy medium of performance (through compilation) and safety (through
    strict typing and garbage collection). Go is very similar to C in many
    ways so it should look fairly familiar to you (like learning Italian if
    you already know Spanish). However, it is also not so similar to C in many ways 
    so your first task in this project will be to learn
    Go! Fortunately, there are excellent tools for this. I'll list a few
    here:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Basic Installation
            Instructions</a>: Go is available on the Hive machines, but you'll
          probably want to get it working locally to ease development.</li>
        <li><a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html">Overview of Go tools and
            other practical things</a>: Go is very particular about how files
          are layed out on your computer and a few environment variables, be
          sure to read this whole document before trying to write your own Go
               code! Of particular importance is <b>making sure you have the
          environment variable <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH">
            $GOPATH set correctly</a></b> since all the go tools (and these
          instructions) rely on this. This will be set automatically on the
          Hive machines, but you'll need to set it up on your local
          machine.</li>
        <li><a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">Go Language
            Tutorial</a>: While you're encouraged to go through this entire
          tutorial, you probably won't need all of it. You should focus on the
          first two sections of "Basics" ("packages, variables, and functions"
          and "Flow control statements") and "Concurrency" (the main focus of
          this project).</li>
      </ol>

    <p><i>hint:</i> The word "Go" isn't easily googled, so you should use the
    term "golang" in any searches.</p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>Before starting, make sure you've gone through the tutorials above and
    can at least run "hello world".  <b><font color="red">Imporant: your
    $GOPATH environment variable should be set to your go directory. Test this
    now by typing <code>echo $GOPATH</code>. If you don't see the path to your
    go folder, re-read the <a
    href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces">documentation on
    workspaces</a> and try to set up your environment and paths correctly before
    continuing. These instructions won't work if your $GOPATH is wrong.</font></b>
    Your directory tree should look something like:</p>
    <pre>
-$GOPATH/
  -bin/
    -hello
  -src/
    -hello/
      -hello.go
      -hello
    ...</pre>

    <p>If you did the full tour of go, it's likely you'll have considerably
    more directories under "src", and you'll likely have a "~/go/pkg"
    directory. Everytime a new library or package is installed (either
    explicitly using "go get" or automatically by Go when it sees a
    dependency), it will be added to your src/ directory.</p>

    <p>We have provided the classifier and cache services as a Go package. You
    can install them by running the following command anywhere in your go
    workspace:</p>
    <pre>
    go get github.com/61c-teach/sp18-proj5</pre>

    <p>This command could take a while to run. You may see some warnings (e.g.
    about "linear.cpp"); these can be safely ignored. Before you even start
    with your code, make sure this new package works by running the unit
    tests:</p>
    <pre>
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/61c-teach/sp18-proj5
    source env.sh
    go test</pre>

    <p>You should see all tests passing. The "env.sh" sets up some environment
    variables to work around a bug in the classifier, you'll need to "source"
    it (like above) before running anything that uses the classifier (like your
    code).</p>
    <p>     <i>Note: The source command reads a shell script and executes it
    exactly as if you had typed the contents yourself. This lets you change
  your current shell (e.g. to setup environment variables). Most shell scripts
  create a new subshell before running, so changes to the environment wouldn't
be saved.</i></p>

    <p>Check your $GOPATH/src directory, you should see some new folders:</p>
    <pre>
-$GOPATH/src
  -hello/
  -github.com/
    -61c-teach/
    -gonum/
    -petar/
    -sjwhitworth/
  -gonum.org/
  ...</pre>
    
    <p>These new directories were automatically pulled in by Go. For example,
    classifier.go imports "github.com/petar/GoMNIST", which is a package to help
    read in the image files that we'll be classifying. You are free to import
    packages as well if they'll help you. Just make sure they can be imported
    automatically like this (typically if they are a public repo on a common
    site like github it will work). See the "Submission" section below for
    instructions on how to verify your code will work with our autograder.</p>

    <p>Now you're ready to get started with your code. The first thing you'll
    need to do is create an empty bitbucket repo for this project, name it
    proj5-xxx (where xxx is your login). Next, create a folder for it in your
    local Go workspace. Go is very particular about where code lives in the
    workspace, so it's important that you create the directory scheme exactly
    as described. Once you have the directory setup, you can clone your
    (currently empty) repo into it:</p>

    <pre>
      mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.org/YOUR_BITBUCKET_LOGIN
      cd $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.org/YOUR_BITBUCKET_LOGIN
      git clone https://bitbucket.org/YOUR_BITBUCKET_LOGIN/proj5-xxx.git</pre> 

    <p>Don't forget to replace YOUR_BITBUCKET_LOGIN and proj5-xxx with your
    logins.</p>
    <p>You can now populate it by grabbing the starter code we provide for
    you: <a href="proj5-starter.tar">proj5-starter.tar</a>. You'll need to
    unpack the tar file in your proj5-xxx directory.</p>
   
    <p><i>Hint: Tar files package up a bunch of files (and directories) into a
      single file to make it easier to share. They sometimes also include
      compression (e.g. .tar.gz). Google "extract tar file" to see how to
      unpack one.</p></i>
    <p><i>Fun fact: Tar stands for "tape archive" and was originally
      designed for backing filesystems up onto large magnetic tapes. It's still
      used for that (my first internship was working with tar on tape drives),
      but it gets used for lots of other reasons now.</i></p>

    <p>Once you've done this, run the unit tests using "go test". It should
    fail the unit test with the following error: "The cache didn't seem to
    help." This is because the starter code simply forwards all requests to the
    classifier, it doesn't cache at all. If you look in memoizer_test.go,
    you'll see that we time how long it takes to classify a bunch of images,
    then we time a second run of the same images. If the cache is working, the
    second run should be <i>much</i> faster than the first (at least 2x is
    required to pass the test, the staff solution is 10x faster).</p>
    
    <p>Be sure to commit these new files so you have a
    clean initial commit (you'll probably want to delete proj5-starter.tar
    since it's not needed anymore).</p>

    <p>You're now ready to start working on the project! Your go workspace should look something like:</p>
    <pre>
-$GOPATH/src
  -bitbucket.org/
    -example_user/
      -proj5-aaa/
        -memoizer.go
        -memoizer_test.go
        -env.sh
        -data/
  -hello/
  -github.com/
    -61c-teach/
    -gonum/
    -petar/
    -sjwhitworth/
  -gonum.org/
  ...</pre>

    <h2>Project Details: Part 1</h2>
    <p>Go's abstraction for concurrency is called "goroutines". Each goroutine
    runs on a different logical thread. The langauge runtime decides exactly
    which physical thread it runs on and when, this means that you (as the
    programmer) don't always know when/where a routine is executing. To help
    decouple them (so that you don't have to know), go provides an abstraction
    called channels. Channels are queues (FIFO) where a sending goroutine can
    push a message, and the receiving goroutine can pop. While it is possible
    to use locks and shared variables, this is discouraged in Go. If you
    haven't already, be sure to work through the <a
    href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1">tutorial</a> on goroutines and
    channels.</p>

    <p>In this project, each service that you'll be using takes the form of a
    goroutine. Each service also comes with a handle to help communicate with
    it. Handles package up a request channel and a response channel. Clients of
    the service send requests of the reqQ channel, and wait for responses on
    the the respQ. Look at the test files for each service to see how they get
    used. Notice how good unit tests not only serve to check code correctness,
    they are also a valuable source of documentation.</p> 

    <h3>The Classifier Service</h3>
    <p><i>sp18-proj5/classifier.go</i></p>
    <img src="mnist4.png" style="width: 10%;" class="center"/>
    <p>The classifier service is designed to translate hand-written digits from
    the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST
    dataset</a>. The input to it is a []byte (byte slice, see the go tutorial
    on <a href="https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/7">slices</a>) which
    represents a 28x28 pixel image (784 pixels total). If you're curious, you
    can use the provided "Show" function in memoizer_test.go to save these
    images as pngs (like the example above).  The classifier then runs an
    ensemble of support vector machine classifiers, one for each digit, and
    picks the most likely digit to return (as an int).  Like every service in
    this project, the classifier accepts a request ID with every request, and
    returns that ID with the corresponding response. This allows for
    potentially out-of-order messages (which can occur due to network issues or
    from optimizations). Note that the current classifier implementation will
    always respond in order, but you are free to return messages out of order
    from your memoization service. Note also that the classifier response
    includes a potential error message. Under normal operation, this feild is
    always "nil", but it may contain an error message if something went wrong.
    You <b>may not</b> assume that all classification requests will succeed.
    Take a look at classifier_test.go for examples on how to use the classifier
    service.</p>

    <h3>The Cache Service</h3>
    <p><i>sp18-proj5/cache.go</i></p>
    <p>The caching service is essentially a remote hash table. You give it
    key-value pairs and it saves them for later. You can then ask it if it's
    seen a particular key and it will return the corresponding value (if any).
    Caching services like this are extremely common in datacenters, examples
    include <a href="https://memcached.org/">memcached</a> and
    <a href="https://redis.io/">redis</a>. Caching services reduce the load on
    other services by saving frequent or recent results. Our cache in this
    project is a very simple key-value store. You may assume that it will never
    fill up (no need to deal with eviction/replacement). You send it requests
    using the CacheReq struct which contains a read/write flag, a 64-bit key,
    an int value, and (like everything) a 64-bit requestID. If the request is
    a write, then the cache will not respond. If the request is a read, then
    the cache will respond with a CacheResp struct that contains an "exists"
    flag (true if the item was found) and the corresponding value (if any), and
    the requestID. Check out cache_test.go for examples on how to use it.</p>
    
    <p><b>Note: The requestID only needs to be unique for reads from the cache.
    Write requests do not need to have unique requestIDs.</b></p>

    <p>Note that the key is a 64-bit integer, but the images we are using are
    byte slices. To deal with this, you will need to use a hash of the image as
    a key. While there could, technically, be collisions on this hash function,
    the chances of that are sufficently low for our application to work (you
    may assume that collisions will never happen). Afterall, we are using
    machine learning to classify the images which is far more likely to give a
    bad label than a hash-collision would. We recommend taking a look at Go's
    <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/hash/crc64/">crc64 hash function</a>,
    although you are free to use any hash function you wish (so long as it has
    a similarly low collision probability). It's not recommended to write your
    own hash function, there are existing libraries for that sort of thing.</p>

    <h3>The Memoization Layer</h3>
    <p><i>proj5-xxx/memoizer.go</i></p>
    <p>Your main task in this assignment is to write a memoization service. The
    memoization service will use the cache service to speed up requests to
    classify images that have already been seen before. This means that your
    code must be significantly faster to respond to images that have been seen
    before versus new images.  Existing users of the classifier should be able
    to drop your memoization service in and immediately see benefits without
    changing any of their existing code. This means that <b>your code must
    implement the exact same interface as the classifier</b>. Note that the
    starter code we've given you simply forwards the client's requests to the
    classifier, and returns the classifier responses to the client. One
    difference is that you are permitted to return results out of order, so
    long as the message IDs match.</p>

    <p>Memoizer Requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Must respond to previously-seen image requests significantly faster than new images.</li>
      <li>Must implement the same API as the classifier service. This means
        that you may not change the function signature, message types, or
        return different results (other than different orderings).</li>
      <li>May not panic/crash, even if the other services behave badly.
        <ul>
          <li>Any errors in the cache service must be ignored (you can always
            ask the classifier again for the label).</li>
          <li>Any errors in the classifier that can't be serviced by the cache
            must be forwarded to the client.</li>
          <li>Any errors in the memoization service itself should return an
            error describing the problem (in the MnistResp err feild). You can
            use <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Errorf">fmt.Errorf</a> to
            generate the error, see <a href="https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go">here</a>
            for more information about errors in go.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing: Part 2</h2>
    <p><b><font color="red">
      More details about part 2 will be released early
      next week. Check back then for more details on specific testing
      requirements.
    </font></b></p>
    <p>Testing is a central requirement of practical software development. It is
    common for there to be more test code than application code. Go makes this
    very easy (<a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing">this</a> is a
    quick rundown of testing in go, you can also just google for "golang
    testing"). We've provided a few tests to get you started, but they are not
    sufficient. You will need to write more tests to make sure your code meets
    all the requirements (especially the "may not panic/crash" requirement).
    The existing tests use the real classifier and cache, which are unlikely to
    fail or behave badly. You will likely need to implement dummy versions of
    these services that exhibit different types of errors. Note that these
    dummy services don't actually have to work at all, it may be enough to
    write a service that always responds to requests with some bogus error.</p>

    <p>We will be providing a tool to help you evaluate your tests soon. To
    start with, just try to get the basic tests passing and start thinking
    about what else might go wrong.</p>
    <!-- This is where I will add stuff about code coverage and describe the test-case autograder -->

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>We will be grading both your memoizer.go and memoizer_test.go files. Do
    not add any additional files or rename these files (or the functions within
    them). Before submitting, we recommend you test your code in a fresh go
    workspace. This makes sure that you're not relying on any uncommitted files
    or broken dependencies. To do this, create a new go directory, update your
    $GOPATH, and then clone and test your code:</p>
<pre>
export GOPATH=~/go_clean
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.org/YOUR_BITBUCKET_LOGIN
cd $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.org/YOUR_BITBUCKET_LOGIN
git clone https://bitbucket.org/YOUR_BITBUCKET_LOGIN/proj5-xxx.git
cd proj5-xxx
go get github.com/61c-teach/sp18-proj5
go test</pre> 
    
    <p>If your tests pass in the clean go workspace, then we shouldn't have any trouble running it either. You can now delete the whole go_clean workspace and reset your GOPATH:</p>
    <pre>
cd ~
rm -rf ~/go_clean/
export GOPATH=~/go</pre>

    <p>To submit, you must run the submit command from your proj5-xxx directory:</p>
    <pre class="output">$ <span class="input">submit proj5</span></pre>

    <p>You must also make sure to create a tag in your bitbucket repo for your submission:</p>
    <pre class="output">
$ <span class="input">git add -u</span> # should add all modified files in the memoizer directory
$ <span class="input">git commit -m "Project 5 submission"</span>
$ <span class="input">git tag -f "proj5-sub"</span> # The tag MUST be "proj5-sub". Failure to do so will result in loss of credit.
$ <span class="input">git push origin master --tags</span> # Note the "--tags" at the end. This pushes tags to bitbucket</pre>
