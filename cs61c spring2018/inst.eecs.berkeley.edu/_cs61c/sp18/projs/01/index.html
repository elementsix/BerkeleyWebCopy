        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of this project is to serve as an
          introduction to the C language. This project will cover a
          lot of different features of the C language, including the
          C file input/output library, memory allocation, string
          manipulation, and string coercion to void pointers and
          vice versa. Although there is conceptually a lot to learn
          to complete this project, the actual code you need to
          write is relatively short.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Philphix is a very simple and silly replacement tool
          that accepts a single command line argument, the name of a
          replacement set to use. This replacement set consists of
          pairs of "words", each pair on its own line. The first
          word only consists of alphanumeric characters, but the
          second word can include any non-whitespace printable
          character.
       </p>
        <p>
          For each word (sequence of letters and numbers unbroken
          by any other character) in the input it processes it to
          see if it should be replaced. It first checks if that
          word is in the replacement set, then checks that word
          with all but the first character converted to lower
          case, and finally checks if the word converted
          completely to lower case. If there is no match the word
          is printed to standard output unchanged; if there is
          a match, it prints the highest priority match.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your assignment is to complete the implementation
          of <code>philphix</code>. To do this, you will need to
          implement 4 functions in philphix.c: <code>stringHash(void
          *s)</code>, <code>stringEquals(void *s1, void
          *s2)</code>, <code>readDictionary(char *filename)</code>,
          and <code>processInput()</code>.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Just as a reminder, this project is to be
          completed <b>individually</b>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="setup">
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>
          To get starter code for this project, we will be using git.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li> 
            First, you need to create a private repo with the
            format proj1-xxx, where xxx is your login. The process for
            this is very similar to what was done in lab. Please make
            sure this repo is <b>NOT</b> your work repo however. 
            Furthermore, please set this to <b>PRIVATE</b>. Just 
            to make sure, set this to <b>PRIVATE</b>. If you do not
            set this to <b>PRIVATE</b>, horrible things will
            happen to you and you will be severely punished. So before
            continuing, make sure your repo is <b>PRIVATE</b>.
            Not setting your repo to private, even if by mistake, will 
            be seen as an intention to cheat.
          </li>
          <li> 
            From your access management settings, give
            'cs61c-staff' admin access to your repo. You also must
            do this from the very beginning to avoid any penalties
            placed upon your grade.
          </li>
          <li>
            Did you set your repo to <b>PRIVATE</b> and
            give the 'cs61c-staff' admin access? If yes, enter into
            the directory of your class account that you would like to
            hold your proj1-xxx repository. Once in this directory, run
            the following:
            <pre>
git clone https://mybitbucketusername@bitbucket.org/mybitbucketusername/proj1-xxx.git
cd proj1-xxx
git remote add proj1-starter https://github.com/61c-teach/sp18-proj1-starter.git
git fetch proj1-starter
git merge proj1-starter/master -m "merge proj1 skeleton code"</pre> 
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p> 
          Once you complete these steps, you will have the proj1
          directory inside of your repository, which contains the
          files you need to begin working.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you develop your code, you should make commits in
          your git repo and push them as you see fit. Be sure to
          project.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          After you have a copy of the starter code, make sure you
          have the following files:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>hashtable.c</code> - Code for a generic hashtable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>hashtable.h</code> - Header file for
            hashtable.c. For more information on header files and
            how they are used, check
            out <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_header_files.htm"
 target="_blank">this</a> link. You should not need to
            modify either hashtable file, though take a look at them
            and see how they work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>philphix.c</code> - Contains various functions for
            our spellchecker. You will need to implement 4 functions
            in philphix.c: <code>stringHash(void
            *s)</code>, <code>stringEquals(void *s1, void
            *s2)</code>, <code>readDictionary(char
            *filename)</code>, and <code>processInput()</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>philphix.h</code> - Header file defining functions
            in philphix.c. You may modify philphix.h if you wish to
            declare additional helper functions which you implement
            in philphix.c.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Makefile</code> - Makefile for compiling philphix,
            as well as for running tests. For more information on
            Makefiles and how they are used, check
            out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile"
            target="_blank">this</a> link.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>diff.sh</code> - A bash script to use for additional testing. This will only work
	    on Linux/Mac machines. First run <code>chmod +x diff.sh</code> and then run <code>./diff.sh</code>
	    to see how to use the script. Use this script for additional testing once your code works on the
	    given testing, replacement, and reference files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>replace.txt</code> - Sample set of replacement rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>test.txt</code> - Sample input file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>reference.txt</code> - Sample output file.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p> 
          Spend some time looking over these files and figuring
          out what is in each file and what they are used for.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p> 
          As noted above, your task is to implement the 4
          functions in philphix.c: <code>stringHash(void
          *s)</code>, <code>stringEquals(void *s1, void
          *s2)</code>, <code>readDictionary(char *filename)</code>,
          and <code>processInput()</code>. More information about the
          purpose of each of these functions can be found inside
          philphix.c.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can type the following in your project 1 directory to
          compile and test your program against a sample set of
          inputs:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ make test</pre>
        <p>
          You can, however, safely output all sorts of debugging information
          to stderr, as this will be ignored by our scripts and by the
          test routine provided in the Makefile.
        </p>
        <p>
          While completing this project will require getting
          familiar with many parts of the C language (C file
          input/output library, do memory allocation, manipulate
          strings, and coerce strings to void pointers and vice versa
          just to name a few), your final solution should not be all
          that long.
        </p>
        <p> 
          <b>Start early!</b> You likely will have to learn and
          experiment a lot with C to complete this project, so make
          sure you budget enough time.
        </p>
        <p> 
          For grading purposes, we will be splitting the project
          into two parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            When you first are writing your solution to the
            project, you can assume that that both the replacement set and
            the input won't contain words longer than <b>60</b>
            characters. Sucessfully doing this will be worth <b>70%</b> of
            your grade on the project.
          </li>
          <li> 
            For the remainding <b>30%</b> of your grade, 
            we will test your code against both dictionaries and inputs that
            contain words of an unbounded length. We suggest trying to
            get a solution with a bounded character count before
            attempting this part.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="submission">
        <h2>Submissions</h2>
        <p>
          There are <b>two</b> steps required to submit
          proj1. Failure to perform both steps will result in loss
          of credit:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, you must submit using the standard unix
            submit program on the instructional servers. This assumes
            that you followed the earlier instructions and did all of
            your work inside of your <code>git</code> repository. To
            submit, follow these instructions after logging into your
            cs61c-xxx class account:
            <pre>
cd proj1-xxx 
submit proj1</pre>
            Once you type <code>submit proj1</code>, follow the
            prompts generated by the submission system. It will tell
            you when your submission has been successful and you can
            confirm this by looking at the output of <code>glookup -t</code>. 
            Remember, you only need to submit two
            files: <code>philphix.c</code> and <code>philphix.h</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, you must submit proj1 to your
            bitbucket repository. To do so, follow these instructions
            after logging into your cs61c-xxx class account:
            <pre>
cd proj1-xxx
git add -u # should add all modified files in proj1 directory
git commit -m "Project 1 submission"
git tag -f "proj1-sub" # The tag MUST be "proj1-sub". Failure to do so will result in loss of credit.
git push origin master --tags # Note the "--tags" at the end. This pushes tags to bitbucket</pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="grading">
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>
          The grading for this project will be done almost
          entirely by automated scripts. Your output must exactly
          match the specified format, which makes correctness the
          primary goal of this project. Again, you are to do this work
          individually.
        </p>
	<P>
	  One particular aspect of C is <i>nondeterminism</i>:
	  something that may run perfectly fine on one computer
	  doesn't run the same way on another due to memory bugs or
	  other issues.  We will be grading exclusively on
	  the <I>hive</I> cluster, so you must make sure your code
	  works correctly on those systems.  And although we will
	  attempt to help you run your code on your own computer
	  rather than the hive, please understand that running on your
	  own computer may result in problems we are not equipped to
	  debug.
	</P>
	<p>
          One significant aspect that you should focus on is
          testing. You can create some python scripts to produce
          larger sets of input. Other good tests for robustness
          include using large binaries on standard input (with the
          output redirected to <code>/dev/null</code>).
