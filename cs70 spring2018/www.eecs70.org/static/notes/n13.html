<h1 id="introduction-to-discrete-probability" class="unnumbered">Introduction to Discrete Probability</h1>
<p>In the last note we considered the probabilistic experiment where we flipped a fair coin <span class="math inline">\(10000\)</span> times and counted the number of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>s. We asked “what is the chance that we get between <span class="math inline">\(4900\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5100\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>s”. One of the lessons was that the remarkable concentration of the fraction of Hs had something to do with the astronomically large number of possible outcomes of <span class="math inline">\(10000\)</span> coin flips.</p>
<p>In this note we will formalize all these notions for an arbitrary probabilistic experiment. We will start by introducing the space of all possible outcomes of the experiment, called a sample space. Each element of the sample space is assigned a probability - which tells us how likely it is to occur when we actually perform the experiment. The mathematical formalism we introduce might take you some time to get used to. But you should remember that ultimately it is just a precise way to say what we mean when we describe a probabilistic experiment like flipping a coin <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times.</p>
<h1 id="random-experiments" class="unnumbered">Random Experiments</h1>
<p>In general, a probabilistic experiment consists of drawing a sample of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> elements from a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of cardinality <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. The possible outcomes of such an experiment are exactly the objects that we counted in the last note. Recall from the last note that we considered four possible scenarios for counting, depending upon whether we sampled with or without replacement, and whether the order in which the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> elements are chosen does or does not matter. The same will be the case for our probabilistic experiments. The outcome of the random experiment is called a <span><em>sample point</em></span>. The <span><em>sample space</em></span>, often denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, is the set of all possible outcomes.</p>
<p>An example of such an experiment is tossing a coin <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> times. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(S = \{H,T\}\)</span> and we are drawing 4 elements with replacement. <span class="math inline">\(HTHT\)</span> is an example of a sample point and the sample space has <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> elements:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n13-samplespace.png" style="width:30.0%" />

</div>
<p>How do we determine the chance of each particular outcome, such as <span class="math inline">\(HHTH\)</span>, of our experiment? In order to do this, we need to define the probability for each sample point, as we will do below.</p>
<h1 id="probability-spaces" class="unnumbered">Probability Spaces</h1>
<p>A <em>probability space</em> is a sample space <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, together with a <em>probability</em> <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[\omega]\)</span> for each sample point <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, such that</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0\le{\mathbb{P}}[\omega]\le 1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(\omega\in\Omega\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle\sum_{\omega\in\Omega}{\mathbb{P}}[\omega] = 1\)</span>, i.e., the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to assign probabilities to sample points is uniformly: if <span class="math inline">\(|\Omega| = N\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[x] = 1/N\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \in \Omega\)</span>. For example, if we toss a fair coin <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> times, each of the <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> sample points (as pictured above) is assigned probability <span class="math inline">\(1/16\)</span>. We will see examples of non-uniform probability distributions soon.</p>
<p>After performing an experiment, we are often interested in knowing whether an event occurred. For example, we might be interested in the event that there were “exactly <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>’s in four tosses of the coin&quot;. How do we formally define the concept of an event in terms of the sample space <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>? Here is a beautiful answer. We will identify the event “exactly <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>’s in four tosses of the coin&quot; with the subset consisting of those outcomes in which there are exactly two <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>’s:<br />
<span class="math inline">\(\{HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, THHT, THTH, TTHH\} \subseteq \Omega\)</span>. Now we turn this around and say that formally an <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is just a subset of the sample space, <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq \Omega\)</span>.</p>
<p>How should we define the probability of an event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>? Naturally, we should just <span><em>add up</em></span> the probabilities of the sample points in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>For any event <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq \Omega\)</span>, we define the <em>probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span></em> to be <span class="math display">\[{\mathbb{P}}[A] = \sum_{\omega\in A} {\mathbb{P}}[\omega].\]</span></p>
<p>Thus the probability of getting exactly two <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>’s in four coin tosses can be calculated using this definition as follows. <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> consists of all sequences that have exactly two <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>’s, and so <span class="math inline">\(|A| ={4\choose 2}= 6\)</span>. For this example, there are <span class="math inline">\(2^4 = 16\)</span> possible outcomes for flipping four coins. Thus, each sample point <span class="math inline">\(\omega \in A\)</span> has probability <span class="math inline">\(1/16\)</span>; and, as we saw above, there are six sample points in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, giving us <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A] = 6 \cdot 1/16 = 3/8\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="examples" class="unnumbered">Examples</h1>
<p>We will now look at examples of random experiments and their corresponding sample spaces, along with possible probability spaces and events.</p>
<h2 id="coin-flipping" class="unnumbered">Coin Flipping</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a coin of bias <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and our experiment consists of flipping the coin <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> times. The sample space <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> consists of the sixteen possible sequences of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>’s shown in the figure earlier.</p>
<p>The probability space depends on <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(p = 1/2\)</span> the probabilities are assigned uniformly; the probability of each sample point is <span class="math inline">\(1/16\)</span>. What if the coin comes up heads with probability <span class="math inline">\(2/3\)</span> and tails with probability <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span> (i.e. the bias is <span class="math inline">\(p = 2/3\)</span>)? Then the probabilities are different. For example, <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[HHHH]=(2/3) \cdot (2/3) \cdot (2/3) \cdot (2/3) = 16/81\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[TTHH]=(1/3) \cdot (1/3) \cdot (2/3) \cdot (2/3) = 4/81\)</span>. [<span><em>Note: We have cheerfully <span>multiplied</span> probabilities here; we’ll explain why this is OK later. It is <span>not</span> always OK!</em></span>]</p>
<p>What type of events can we consider in this setting? Let event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the event that all four coin tosses are the same. Then <span class="math inline">\(A = \{HHHH,TTTT\}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(HHHH\)</span> has probability <span class="math inline">\((2/3)^4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(TTTT\)</span> has probability <span class="math inline">\((1/3)^4\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A] = {\mathbb{P}}[HHHH] + {\mathbb{P}}[TTTT] = (2/3)^4 + (1/3)^4 = 17/81\)</span>.</p>
<p>Next, consider event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>: the event that there are exactly two heads. The probability of any particular outcome with two heads (such as <span class="math inline">\(HTHT\)</span>) is <span class="math inline">\((2/3)^2 (1/3)^2\)</span>. How many such outcomes are there? There are <span class="math inline">\({4\choose 2}=6\)</span> ways of choosing the positions of the heads, and these choices completely specify the sequence. So <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[B]=6(2/3)^2 (1/3)^2 = 24/81 = 8/27\)</span>.</p>
<p>More generally, if we flip the coin <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times, we get a sample space <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> of cardinality <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span>. The sample points are all possible sequences of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>’s. If the coin has bias <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and if we consider any sequence of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> coin flips with exactly <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>’s, then the the probability of this sequence is <span class="math inline">\(p^r(1-p)^{n-r}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now consider the event <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> that we get exactly <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>’s when we flip the coin <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times. This event consists of exactly <span class="math inline">\({n \choose r}\)</span> sample points. Each has probability <span class="math inline">\(p^r(1-p)^{n-r}\)</span>. So the probability of this event, <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[C] = {n \choose r}p^r(1-p)^{n-r}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Biased coin-tossing sequences show up in many contexts: for example, they might model the behavior of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> trials of a faulty system, which fails each time with probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>

<p>The next random experiment we will discuss consists of rolling two dice. In this experiment, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega=\{(i,j):1\le i,j\le 6\}\)</span>. The probability space is <em>uniform</em>, i.e. all of the sample points have the <span><em>same</em></span> probability, which must be <span class="math inline">\(1/|\Omega|\)</span>. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(|\Omega| = 36\)</span>, so each sample point has probability <span class="math inline">\(1/36\)</span>. In such circumstances, the probability of any event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is clearly just<span class="math display">\[{\mathbb{P}}[A] = { \#\text{ of sample points in $A$} \over
\#\text{ of sample points in $\Omega$} }
= {{|A|}\over{|\Omega|}}.\]</span> So for uniform spaces, computing probabilities reduces to <span><em>counting</em></span> sample points!</p>
<p>Now consider two events: the event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> that the sum of the dice is at least <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> and the event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> that there is at least one <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>. By writing out the number of sample points in each event, we can determine the number of sample points in each event; <span class="math inline">\(|A| = 6\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|B| = 11\)</span>. By the observation above, it follows that <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A] = 6/36 = 1/6\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[B] = 11/36\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="card-shuffling" class="unnumbered">Card Shuffling</h2>
<p>The random experiment consists of shuffling a deck of cards. <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is equal to the set of the <span class="math inline">\(52!\)</span> permutations of the deck. The probability space is uniform. Note that we’re really talking about an idealized mathematical model of shuffling here; in real life, there will always be a bit of bias in our shuffling. However, the mathematical model is close enough to be useful.</p>
<h2 id="poker-hands" class="unnumbered">Poker Hands</h2>
<p>Here’s another experiment: shuffling a deck of cards and dealing a poker hand. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the set of <span class="math inline">\(52\)</span> cards and our sample space <span class="math inline">\(\Omega = \{\text{all possible poker hands}\}\)</span>, which corresponds to choosing <span class="math inline">\(k=5\)</span> objects without replacement from a set of size <span class="math inline">\(n=52\)</span> where order does not matter. Hence, as we saw in the previous Note, <span class="math inline">\(|\Omega| = {52 \choose 5} = (52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48)/(5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) = 2598960\)</span>. Since the deck is assumed to be randomly shuffled, the probability of each outcome is equally likely and we are therefore dealing with a uniform probability space.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the event that the poker hand is a flush. [For those who are not addicted to gambling, a <span><em>flush</em></span> is a hand in which all cards have the same suit, say Hearts.] Since the probability space is uniform, computing <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A]\)</span> reduces to simply computing <span class="math inline">\(|A|\)</span>, or the number of poker hands which are flushes. There are <span class="math inline">\(13\)</span> cards in each suit, so the number of flushes in each suit is <span class="math inline">\({13}\choose 5\)</span>. The total number of flushes is therefore <span class="math inline">\(4\cdot{{13}\choose 5}\)</span>. Then we have <span class="math display">\[{\mathbb{P}}[\text{hand is a flush}] =
                    {{4\cdot{{13}\choose 5}}\over{{{52}\choose 5}}} =
                    {{4\cdot{13!}\cdot 5!\cdot{47!}}\over{5!\cdot 8!\cdot{52!}}} =
                    {{4\cdot 13\cdot 12\cdot 11\cdot 10\cdot 9}\over
                                {52\cdot 51\cdot 50\cdot 49\cdot 48}}\approx
                    0.002.\]</span></p>
<h2 id="balls-and-bins" class="unnumbered">Balls and Bins</h2>
<p>In this experiment, we will throw <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> (labeled) balls into <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> (labeled) bins. Assume that each ball is equally likely to land in any bin, regardless of what happens to the other balls.</p>
<p>If you wish to understand this situation in terms of sampling a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> elements from a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of cardinality <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>: here the set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> consists of the <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> bins, and we are sampling with replacement <span class="math inline">\(k= 20\)</span> times. The order of sampling matters, since the balls are labeled.</p>
<p>The sample space <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\{(b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_{20}):1\le b_i\le 10\}\)</span>, where the component <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> denotes the bin in which ball <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> lands. The cardinality of the sample space, <span class="math inline">\(|\Omega|\)</span>, is equal to <span class="math inline">\(10^{20}\)</span>- each element <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> in the sequence has <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> possible choices, and there are <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> elements in the sequence. More generally, if we throw <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> balls into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bins, we have a sample space of size <span class="math inline">\(n^m\)</span>. The probability space is uniform; as we said earlier, each ball is equally likely to land in any bin.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the event that bin <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is empty. Since the probability space is uniform, we simply need to count how many outcomes have this property. This is exactly the number of ways all <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> balls can fall into the remaining nine bins, which is <span class="math inline">\(9^{20}\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A]=9^{20}/{10}^{20}=(9/10)^{20}\approx 0.12\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be the event that bin <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> contains at least one ball. This event is the <span><em>complement</em></span> <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, i.e., it consists of precisely those sample points which are not in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[B] = 1 - {\mathbb{P}}[A] \approx .88\)</span>. More generally, if we throw <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> balls into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bins, we have: <span class="math display">\[{\mathbb{P}}[\text{bin $1$ is empty}]=\left({{n-1}\over n}\right)^m=
                            \left({1-{1\over n}}\right)^m.\]</span></p>
<p>As we shall see, balls and bins is another probability space that shows up very often in Computer Science: for example, we can think of it as modeling a load balancing scheme, in which each job is sent to a random processor.</p>
<p>It is also a more general model for problems we have previously considered. For example, flipping a fair coin <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> times is a special case in which the number of balls (<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>) is <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and the number of bins (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) is <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Rolling two dice is a special case in which <span class="math inline">\(m = 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n = 6\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="birthday-paradox" class="unnumbered">Birthday Paradox</h2>
<p>The “birthday paradox” is a remarkable phenomenon that examines the chances that two people in a group have the same birthday. It is a “paradox” not because of a logical contradiction, but because it goes against intuition. For ease of calculation, we take the number of days in a year to be <span class="math inline">\(365\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(U = \{1,\dots,365\}\)</span>, and the random experiment consists of drawing a sample of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements from <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, where the elements are the birth dates of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people in a group. Then <span class="math inline">\(|\Omega| = 365^n\)</span>. This is because each sample point is a sequence of possible birthdays for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people; so there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> points in the sequence and each point has <span class="math inline">\(365\)</span> possible values.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the event that at least two people have the same birthday. If we want to determine <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A]\)</span>, it might be simpler to instead compute the probability of the complement of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[\bar{A}]\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span> is the event that no two people have the same birthday. Since <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A] = 1 - {\mathbb{P}}[\bar{A}]\)</span>, we can then easily compute <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A]\)</span>.</p>
<p>We are again working in a uniform probability space, so we just need to determine <span class="math inline">\(|\bar{A}|\)</span>. Equivalently, we are computing the number of ways there are for no two people to have the same birthday. There are <span class="math inline">\(365\)</span> choices for the first person, <span class="math inline">\(364\)</span> for the second, …, <span class="math inline">\(365-n+1\)</span> choices for the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> person, for a total of <span class="math inline">\(365 \times 364 \times \cdots \times (365-n+1)\)</span>. Note that this is simply an application of the first rule of counting; we are sampling without replacement and the order matters.</p>
<p>Thus we have <span class="math display">\[{\mathbb{P}}[{\bar A}] = \frac{|{\bar A}|}{|\Omega|} =
\frac{365 \times 364 \times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^n}.\]</span> Then <span class="math display">\[{\mathbb{P}}[A] = 1 - \frac{365 \times 364 \times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^n}.\]</span> This allows us to compute <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A]\)</span> as a function of the number of people, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Of course, as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A]\)</span> increases. In fact, with <span class="math inline">\(n=23\)</span> people you should be willing to bet that at least two people do have the same birthday, since then <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A]\)</span> is larger than <span class="math inline">\(50\%\)</span>! For <span class="math inline">\(n=60\)</span> people, <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{P}}[A]\)</span> is over <span class="math inline">\(99\%\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="the-monty-hall-problem" class="unnumbered">The Monty Hall Problem</h1>
<p>In an (in)famous 1970s game show hosted by one Monty Hall, a contestant was shown three doors; behind one of the doors was a prize, and behind the other two were goats. The contestant picks a door (but doesn’t open it). Then Hall’s assistant (Carol), opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat (since Carol knows where the prize is, she can always do this). The contestant is then given the option of sticking with his current door, or switching to the other unopened one. He wins the prize if and only if his chosen door is the correct one. The question, of course, is: Does the contestant have a better chance of winning if he switches doors?</p>
<p>Intuitively, it seems obvious that since there are only two remaining doors after the host opens one, they must have equal probability. So you may be tempted to jump to the conclusion that it should not matter whether or not the contestant stays or switches.</p>
<p>Yet there are other people whose intuition cries out that the contestant is better off switching. So who’s correct?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the contestant has a better chance of picking the car if he uses the switching strategy. How can you convince yourself that this is true? One way you can do this is by doing a rigorous analysis. You would start by writing out the sample space, and then assign probabilities to each sample point. Finally you would calculate the probability of the event that the contestant wins under the sticking strategy. This is an excellent exercise if you wish to make sure you understand the formalism of probability theory we introduced above.</p>
<p>Let us instead give a more intuitive pictorial argument. Initially when the contestant chooses the door, he has a <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span> chance of picking the car. This must mean that the other doors combined have a <span class="math inline">\(2/3\)</span> chance of winning. But after Carol opens a door with a goat behind it, how do the probabilities change? Well, everyone knows that there is a goat behind one of the doors that the contestant did not pick. So no matter whether the contestant is winning or not, Carol is always able to open one of the other doors to reveal a goat. This means that the contestant still has a <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span> chance of winning. Also the door that Carol opened has no chance of winning. What about the last door? It must have a <span class="math inline">\(2/3\)</span> chance of containing the car, and so the contestant has a higher chance of winning if he or she switches doors. This argument can be summed up nicely in the following picture:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n13-monty.png" style="width:50.0%" />

</div>
<p>You will be able to formalize this intuitive argument once we cover conditional probability.</p>
<p>In the meantime, to approach this problem formally, first determine the sample space and the probability space. Just a hint: it is not a uniform probability space! Then formalize the event we have described above (as a subspace of the sample space), and compute the probability of the event. Good luck!</p>
<h1 id="summary" class="unnumbered">Summary</h1>
<p>The examples above illustrate the importance of doing probability calculations systematically, rather than “intuitively&quot;. Recall the key steps in all our calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the <em>sample space</em> (i.e., the experiment and its set of possible outcomes)?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the <em>probability</em> of each outcome (sample point)?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the <em>event</em> we are interested in (i.e., which subset of the sample space)?</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, compute the probability of the event by adding up the probabilities of the sample points inside it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you meet a probability problem, you should always go back to these basics to avoid potential pitfalls. Even experienced researchers make mistakes when they forget to do this — witness many erroneous “proofs”, submitted by mathematicians to newspapers at the time, of the fact that the switching strategy in the Monty Hall problem does not improve the odds.</p>
