<h1 id="polynomials" class="unnumbered">Polynomials</h1>
<p>Polynomials constitute a rich class of functions which are both easy to describe and widely applicable in topics ranging from Fourier analysis, cryptography, and communication, to control and computational geometry. They show up in all sorts of EECS courses including 70’s sister courses 16A/16B, and then in the upper-division courses like 120, 123, etc. In this note, we will discuss some properties of polynomials which make them so useful. We will then describe how to take advantage of these properties to develop a secret sharing scheme.</p>
<p>Recall from your high school math that a <span><em>polynomial</em></span> in a single variable is of the form <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = a_d x^d + a_{d-1} x^{d-1} + \cdots + a_0\)</span>. Here the <span><em>variable</em></span> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the <span><em>coefficients</em></span> <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> are usually real numbers. For example, <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = 5x^3 + 2x + 1\)</span>, is a polynomial of <span><em>degree</em></span> <span class="math inline">\(d = 3\)</span>. Its coefficients are <span class="math inline">\(a_3 = 5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_2 = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_1 = 2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(a_0 = 1\)</span>. Polynomials have some remarkably simple, elegant, and powerful properties, which we will explore in this note.</p>
<p>First, a definition: we say that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a <span><em>root</em></span> of the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(p(a) = 0\)</span>. For example, the degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = x^2 - 4\)</span> has two roots, namely <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-2\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(p(2) = p(-2) = 0\)</span>. If we plot the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> plane, then the roots of the polynomial are just the places where the curve crosses the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n8-quad.png" style="width:30.0%" />

</div>
<p>Notice that the graph goes through the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis at exactly two points, which are the roots (also known as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-intercepts). Another interesting fact about polynomials is that the sum of two degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> polynomials results in a polynomial of at most degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(q(x) = 5x^2 + x + 4\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> both have degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p(x) + q(x) = 8x2 + 3x + 5\)</span>, which is also a degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> polynomial. It is possible but unusual for the degree of the sum to decrease. (Take <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = x^2 + x + 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q(x) = -x^2 + x + 1\)</span>. Both polynomials have degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(p(x) + q(x) = 2x + 2\)</span>, which only has degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.) For this reason we will not explicitly focus on the case when the degree decreases unless it is fairly relevant to the explanation. You should keep this in mind as you read through this material. Now, we will discuss some very remarkable properties of polynomials and build powerful tools using only these simple and elegant facts.</p>
<p>We now state two fundamental properties of polynomials that we will prove in due course.</p>
<p><span id="prop:prop1" class="pandoc-numbering-text prop"><strong>Property 1</strong></span></p>
<p><em>A non-zero polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> has at most <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> roots.</em></p>
<p><span id="prop:prop2" class="pandoc-numbering-text prop"><strong>Property 2</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Given <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> pairs <span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_{d+1}, y_{d+1})\)</span>, with all the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> distinct, there is a unique polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> of degree (at most) <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p(x_i) = y_i\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq i \leq d+1\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>Let us consider what these two properties say in the case that <span class="math inline">\(d =1\)</span>. A graph of a linear (degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>) polynomial <span class="math inline">\(y = a_1 x + a_0\)</span> is a line. <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a> says that if a line is not the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis (i.e. if the polynomial is not <span class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span>), then it can intersect the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis in at most one point.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n8-line1.jpg" style="width:50.0%" />

</div>
<p><a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a> says that two points uniquely determine a line.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n8-line3.jpg" style="width:20.0%" />

</div>
<h2 id="polynomial-interpolation" class="unnumbered">Polynomial Interpolation</h2>
<p><a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a> says that two points uniquely determine a degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> polynomial (a line), three points uniquely determine a degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> polynomial, four points uniquely determine a degree <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> polynomial, and so on. Given <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> pairs <span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_{d+1}, y_{d+1})\)</span>, how do we determine the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = a_d x^d + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p(x_i) = y_i\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i = 1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span>? We will give a very simple algorithm<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> for reconstructing the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(a_0, \ldots, a_d\)</span>, and therefore the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The method is called <span><em>Lagrange interpolation</em></span>: Let us start by solving an easier problem. Suppose that we are told that <span class="math inline">\(y_1 =1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_j = 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(2 \leq j \leq d+1\)</span>. Now can we reconstruct <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>? Yes, this is easy! Consider <span class="math inline">\(q(x) = (x - x_2)(x - x_3) \cdots (x-x_{d+1})\)</span>. This is a polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> (the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>’s are constants, and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> appears <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> times). Also, we clearly have <span class="math inline">\(q(x_j) = 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(2 \leq j \leq d+1\)</span>. But what is <span class="math inline">\(q(x_1)\)</span>? Well, <span class="math inline">\(q(x_1) = (x_1 - x_2)(x_1 - x_3) \cdots (x_1 - x_{d+1})\)</span>, which is some constant not equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Thus if we let <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = q(x)/q(x_1)\)</span> (dividing is ok since <span class="math inline">\(q(x_1) \neq 0\)</span>), we have the polynomial we are looking for. For example, suppose you were given the pairs <span class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((2,0)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((3,0)\)</span>. Then we can construct the degree <span class="math inline">\(d = 2\)</span> polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> by letting <span class="math inline">\(q(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3) = x^2 - 5x + 6\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(q(x_1) = q(1) = 2\)</span>. Thus, we can now construct <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = q(x)/q(x_1) = (x^2 - 5x + 6)/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Of course the problem is no harder if we single out some arbitrary index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>: i.e. <span class="math inline">\(y_i = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_j = 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j \neq i\)</span>. Let us introduce some notation: let us denote by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_i(x)\)</span> the degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> polynomial that goes through these <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> points. Then <span class="math display">\[\Delta_i(x) = \frac{\prod_{j\neq i} (x-x_j)}{\prod_{j\neq i} (x_i-x_j)}.\]</span></p>
<p>Let us now return to the original problem. Given <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> pairs <span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_{d+1}, y_{d+1})\)</span>, we first construct the <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> polynomials <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{1}(x), \ldots , \Delta_{d+1}(x)\)</span>. Now we can write <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = \sum_{i = 1}^{d+1} y_i \Delta_i(x)\)</span>. Why does this work? First notice that <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is a polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> as required, since it is the sum of polynomials of degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. And when it is evaluated at <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> terms in the sum evaluate to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th term evaluates to <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> times <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, as required.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose we want to find the degree-<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> that passes through the three points <span class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((2,2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((3,4)\)</span>. The three polynomials <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_i\)</span> are as follows: If <span class="math inline">\(d = 2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x_i = i\)</span>, for instance, then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\Delta_1(x) &amp;= \frac{(x - 2)(x - 3)}{(1 - 2)(1 - 3)} = \frac{(x - 2)(x - 3)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x + 3;\\
\Delta_2(x) &amp;= \frac{(x - 1)(x - 3)}{(2 - 1)(2 - 3)} = \frac{(x - 1)(x - 3)}{-1} = -x^2 +4x -3;\\
\Delta_3(x) &amp;= \frac{(x - 1)(x - 2)}{(3 - 1)(3 - 2)} = \frac{(x - 1)(x - 2)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}x^2 -\frac{3}{2}x +1.\end{aligned}\]</span> The polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is therefore given by <span class="math display">\[p(x) = 1\cdot\Delta_1(x) + 2\cdot\Delta_2(x) + 4\cdot\Delta_3(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 -\frac{1}{2}x +1.\]</span> You should verify that this polynomial does indeed pass through the above three points.</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-property-2" class="unnumbered">Proof of <a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a></h3>
<p>We would like to prove <a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a>.</p>
<p>We have shown how to find a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p(x_i) = y_i\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> pairs <span class="math inline">\((x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_{d+1},y_{d+1})\)</span>. This proves part of <a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a> (the existence of the polynomial). How do we prove the second part, that the polynomial is unique? Suppose for contradiction that there is another polynomial <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(q(x_i) = y_i\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> pairs above. Now consider the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(r(x) = p(x) - q(x)\)</span>. Since we are assuming that <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> are different polynomials, <span class="math inline">\(r(x)\)</span> must be a non-zero polynomial of degree at most <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Therefore, <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a> implies it can have at most <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> roots. But on the other hand <span class="math inline">\(r(x_i) = p(x_i) - q(x_i) = 0\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> distinct points. Contradiction. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is the unique polynomial that satisfies the <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> conditions.</p>
<h2 id="polynomial-division" class="unnumbered">Polynomial Division</h2>
<p>Let’s take a short digression to discuss polynomial division, which will be useful in the proof of <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a>. If we have a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> of degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, we can divide by a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> of degree <span class="math inline">\(\leq d\)</span> by using elementary-school long division. The result will be: <span class="math display">\[p(x) = q(x)q&#39;(x) + r(x)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(q&#39;(x)\)</span> is the quotient and <span class="math inline">\(r(x)\)</span> is the remainder. The degree of <span class="math inline">\(r(x)\)</span> must be smaller than the degree of <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> We wish to divide <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 1\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(q(x) = x - 1\)</span>:</p>
<p>Now <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2 + 2x + 2) + 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r(x) = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q&#39;(x) = x^2 + 2x + 2\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-property-1" class="unnumbered">Proof of <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a></h2>
<p>Now let us turn to <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a>: a non-zero polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> has at most <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> roots.The idea of the proof is as follows. We will prove the following claims:</p>
<p><span id="claim:claim1" class="pandoc-numbering-text claim"><strong>Claim 1</strong></span></p>
<p><em>If <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a root of a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> with degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = (x-a)q(x)\)</span> for a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> with degree <span class="math inline">\(d-1\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><span id="claim:claim2" class="pandoc-numbering-text claim"><strong>Claim 2</strong></span></p>
<p><em>A polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> of degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> with distinct roots <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\dots,a_d\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = c(x-a_1)\cdots(x-a_d)\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><a href="#claim:claim2">Claim 2</a> implies <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a>. We must show that <span class="math inline">\(a \neq a_i\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i = 1, \ldots d\)</span> cannot be a root of <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>. But this follows from <a href="#claim:claim2">Claim 2</a>, since <span class="math inline">\(p(a) = c(a-a_1)\cdots(a-a_d) \neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-claim-1" class="unnumbered">Proof of <a href="#claim:claim1">Claim 1</a></h3>
<p>Dividing <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\((x-a)\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = (x-a)q(x) + r(x)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> is the quotient and <span class="math inline">\(r(x)\)</span> is the remainder. The degree of <span class="math inline">\(r(x)\)</span> is necessarily smaller than the degree of the divisor <span class="math inline">\((x-a)\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(r(x)\)</span> must have degree <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and therefore is some constant <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. But now substituting <span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span>, we get <span class="math inline">\(p(a) = c\)</span>. But since <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a root, <span class="math inline">\(p(a) = 0\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(c= 0\)</span> and therefore <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = (x-a)q(x)\)</span>, thus showing that <span class="math inline">\((x-a) \mid p(x)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="claim-1-implies-claim-2" class="unnumbered"><a href="#claim:claim1">Claim 1</a> Implies <a href="#claim:claim2">Claim 2</a></h3>
<p>Proof by induction on <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Base Case: We must show that a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> of degree 1 with root <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(p(x)  = c(x-a_1)\)</span>. By <a href="#claim:claim1">Claim 1</a>, we know that <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = (x-a_1)q(x)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> has degree 0 and is therefore a constant.</p></li>
<li><p>Inductive Hypothesis: A polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(d-1\)</span> with distinct roots <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\dots,a_{d-1}\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = c(x-a_1)\cdots(x - a_{d-1})\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Inductive Step: Let <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> be a polynomial of of degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> with distinct roots <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\cdots,a_d\)</span>. By <a href="#claim:claim1">Claim 1</a>, <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = (x-a_d)q(x)\)</span> for some polynomial <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> of degree <span class="math inline">\(d-1\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(0 = p(a_i) = (a_i-a_d)q(a_i)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\neq d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_i-a_d \neq 0\)</span> in this case, <span class="math inline">\(q(a_i)\)</span> must be equal to 0. Then <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> is a polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(d-1\)</span> with distinct roots <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\dots,a_{d-1}\)</span>. We can now apply the inductive assumption to <span class="math inline">\(q(x)\)</span> to write <span class="math inline">\(q(x) = c(x-a_1)\cdots(x - a_{d-1})\)</span>. Substituting in <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = (x-a_d)q(x)\)</span>, we finally obtain that <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = c(x-a_1)\cdots(x-a_d)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="finite-fields" class="unnumbered">Finite Fields</h1>
<p>Both <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a> and <a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a> also hold when the values of the coefficients and the variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> are chosen from the complex numbers instead of the real numbers or even the rational numbers. The proofs<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> do not hold if the values are restricted to being natural numbers or integers. Let us try to understand this a little more closely. The only properties of numbers that we used in polynomial interpolation and in the proof of <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a> is that we can add, subtract, multiply and divide any pair of numbers as long as we are not dividing by <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. We cannot subtract two natural numbers and guarantee that the result is a natural number. And dividing two integers does not usually result in an integer.</p>
<p>But if we work with numbers modulo a prime<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, then we can add, subtract, multiply and divide (by any non-zero number modulo <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>). To check this, recall that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has an inverse mod <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(m,x)=1\)</span>, so if <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is prime <span><em>all</em></span> the numbers <span class="math inline">\(\{1,\ldots,m-1\}\)</span> have an inverse mod <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. So both <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a> and <a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a> hold if the coefficients and the variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> are restricted to take on values modulo <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. This remarkable fact that these properties hold even when we restrict ourselves to a <span><em>finite</em></span> set of values is the key to several applications that we will presently see.</p>
<p>Let us consider an example of degree <span class="math inline">\(d = 1\)</span> polynomials modulo <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = 2x + 3 \pmod 5\)</span>. The roots of this polynomial are all values <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(2x + 3 = 0 \pmod 5\)</span> holds. Solving for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we get that <span class="math inline">\(2x = -3 = 2 \pmod 5\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x = 1 \pmod 5\)</span>. Note that this is consistent with <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a> since we got only 1 root of a degree 1 polynomial.</p>
<p>Now consider the polynomials <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = 2x + 3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q(x) = 3x-2\)</span> with all numbers reduced mod <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. We can plot the value of each polynomial <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> plane. Since we are working modulo <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, there are only <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> possible choices for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and only <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> possible choices for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>:</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Notice that these two “lines&quot; intersect in exactly one point, even though the picture looks nothing at all like lines in the Euclidean plane! Looking at these graphs it might seem remarkable that both <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a> and <a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a> hold when we work modulo <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> for any prime number <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. But as we stated above, all that was required for the proofs of <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a> and <a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a> was the ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide any pair of numbers (as long as we are not dividing by <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>), and they hold whenever we work modulo a prime <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>When we work with numbers modulo a prime <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, we say that we are working over a finite field, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_m\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{GF}(m)\)</span> (for Galois Field). In order for a set to be called a field, it must satisfy certain axioms which are the building blocks that allow for these amazing properties and others to hold. If you would like to learn more about fields and the axioms they satisfy, you can visit Wikipedia’s site and read the article on fields: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28mathematics%29</a>. While you are there, you can also read the article on Galois Fields and learn more about some of their applications and elegant properties which will not be covered in this lecture: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_field" class="uri">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_field</a>. (Take Math 113 and Math 114 to really get into this stuff, or take EECS 229B which also covers many of these properties as it builds the fundamentals of error-correcting codes.)</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about fields or finite fields, you can look up a standard book on “Abstract Algebra” or look up wikipedia. In a nutshell, in order for a set to be called a field, it must have addition and multiplication operations defined on the set and must also satisfy certain axioms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Closure under addition and multiplication</p></li>
<li><p>Associativity of addition and multiplication</p></li>
<li><p>Commutativity of addition and multiplication</p></li>
<li><p>Existence of additive and multiplicative identity elements</p></li>
<li><p>Existence of additive inverses and multiplicative inverses</p></li>
<li><p>Distributivity of multiplication and addition</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These axioms imply that a field is also associated with subtraction and division operators. Since these are the operations we rely on in the proofs above, we can view field axioms as the building blocks which allow for these amazing properties and others to hold.</p>
<p>Natural numbers or integers do not satisfy the field axioms. For example, the multiplicative inverse of a natural number is generally not a natural number (i.e. is there a natural number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(5\cdot x = 1\)</span>?). On the other hand, complex, real and rational numbers do constitute fields – and therefore properties 1 and 2 hold as well. The field <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{GF}(m)\)</span> is especially interesting as it is finite. This property will lead to its applicability in several settings, as we will see in the next two sections.</p>
<h1 id="counting" class="unnumbered">Counting</h1>
<p>How many polynomials of degree (at most) <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> are there modulo <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>? This is easy: there are <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> coefficients, each of which can take on one of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> values for a total of <span class="math inline">\(m^3\)</span>. Writing <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = a_d x^d + a_{d-1} x^{d-1} + \cdots + a_0\)</span> by specifying its <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> coefficients <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> is known as the coefficient representation of <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>. Is there any other way to specify <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>?</p>
<p>Sure, there is! Our polynomial of degree (at most) <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is uniquely specified by its values at any three points, say <span class="math inline">\(x = 0, 1, 2\)</span>. Once again each of these three values can take on one of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> values, for a total of <span class="math inline">\(m^3\)</span> possibilities. In general, we can specify a degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> by specifying its values at <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> points, say <span class="math inline">\(0, 1, \ldots , d\)</span>. These <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span> values, <span class="math inline">\((y_0,y_1, \dots,y_d)\)</span> are called the value representation of <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>. The coefficient representation can be converted to the value representation by evaluating the polynomial at <span class="math inline">\(0, 1, \dots, d\)</span>. And as we’ve seen, Lagrange interpolation can convert the value representation to the coefficient representation.</p>
<p>So if we are given three pairs <span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1), (x_2,y_2), (x_3, y_3)\)</span> then there is a unique polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p(x_i) = y_i\)</span>. But now, suppose we were only given two pairs <span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)\)</span>; how many distinct degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> polynomials are there that go through these two points? Notice that there are exactly <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> choices for <span class="math inline">\(y_3\)</span>, and for each choice there is a unique (and distinct) polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> that goes through the three points <span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1), (x_2,y_2), (x_3, y_3)\)</span>. It follows that there are exactly <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> polynomials of degree at most <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> that go through <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> points <span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)\)</span>, as shown below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n8-graph3.jpg" style="width:40.0%" />

</div>
<p>What if you were only given one point <span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1)\)</span>? Well, there are <span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span> choices for <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_3\)</span>, yielding <span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span> polynomials of degree at most <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> that go through the point given. A pattern begins to emerge, as is summarized in the following table:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{|c|}
\hline
\text{polynomials of degree } \le d \text{ over } \mathbb{F}_m \\
\hline
\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{number of points} &amp; \text{number of polynomials} \\
\hline
d + 1 &amp; 1 \\
d &amp; m \\
d - 1 &amp; m^2 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots \\
d - k &amp; m^{k+1} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; m^{d+1}
\end{array} \\
\hline
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the reason that we can count the number of polynomials in this setting is because we are working over a finite field. If we were working over an infinite field such as the rationals, there would be infinitely many polynomials of degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> that can go through <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> points! Think of a line, which has degree one. If you were just given one point, there would be infinitely many possibilities for the second point, each of which uniquely defines a line.</p>
<p>Here we are using the standard coefficient representation of a degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> polynomial. The properties we discussed in the previous sections illustrate that there are two ways to write polynomials: a coefficient representation and a value representation. The coefficient representation of a degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> polynomial can be thought of as a string <span class="math inline">\((a_0,\dots,a_d)\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span>, where the polynomial is equal to <span class="math inline">\(a_dx^d + a_{d-1}x^{d-1} + \cdots + a_0\)</span> and each <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> is an element of <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{GF}(q)\)</span>. The value representation can also be thought of as a string <span class="math inline">\((y_0,\dots,y_d)\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span>, which we interpret as the values of the polynomial at fixed points <span class="math inline">\(x_0,\dots,x_d\in \operatorname{GF}(q)\)</span>. As we’ve seen, polynomial interpolation can convert the value representation to the coefficient representation. The coefficient representation can be converted to the value representation by evaluating the polynomial at <span class="math inline">\(x_0,\dotsc, x_d\)</span>.</p>
<p>What happens if only part of either of these representations is specified? For example, what if we are given only <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> coefficients instead of <span class="math inline">\(d+1\)</span>? Then there are <span class="math inline">\(d+1-k\)</span> coefficients left to choose, and no matter which coefficients we choose, we will end up with a polynomial. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> coefficients specify a class of up to <span class="math inline">\(q^{d+1-k}\)</span> polynomials. The same applies in the value representation, since we are again representing the polynomial by a string of elements in <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{GF}(q)\)</span>. This symmetry is crucial to applications such as secret sharing, which we will see blow.</p>
<h1 id="secret-sharing" class="unnumbered">Secret Sharing</h1>
<p>In the late 1950’s and into the 1960’s, during the Cold War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved instructions and authorized top commanding officers for the use of nuclear weapons under very urgent emergency conditions. Such measures were set up in order to defend the United States in case of an attack in which there was not enough time to confer with the President and decide on an appropriate response. This would allow for a rapid response in case of a Soviet attack on U.S. soil. This is a perfect situation in which a secret sharing scheme could be used to ensure that a certain number of officials must come together in order to successfully launch a nuclear strike, so that for example no single person has the power and control over such a devastating and destructive weapon. Suppose the U.S.  government finally decides that a nuclear strike can be initiated only if at least <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; 1\)</span> major officials agree to it. We want to devise a scheme such that (1) any group of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of these officials can pool their information to figure out the launch code and initiate the strike but (2) no group of <span class="math inline">\(k - 1\)</span> or fewer have any information about the launch code, even if they pool their knowledge. For example, they should not learn whether the secret is odd or even, a prime number, divisible by some number <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, or the secret’s least significant bit. How can we accomplish this?</p>
<p>Suppose that there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> officials indexed from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and the launch code is some natural number <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> be a prime number larger than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. We will work over <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{GF}(q)\)</span> from now on.</p>
<p>Now pick a random polynomial <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> of degree <span class="math inline">\(k - 1\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(P(0) = s\)</span> and give <span class="math inline">\(P(1)\)</span> to the first official, <span class="math inline">\(P(2)\)</span> to the second,…, <span class="math inline">\(P(n)\)</span> to the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span>. Then</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> officials, having the values of the polynomial at <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> points, can use Lagrange interpolation to find <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, and once they know what <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is, they can compute <span class="math inline">\(P(0) = s\)</span> to learn the secret. Another way to say this is that any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> officials have between them a value representation of the polynomial, which they can convert to the coefficient representation, which allows them to evaluate <span class="math inline">\(P(0) = s\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Any group of <span class="math inline">\(k - 1\)</span> officials has <span><strong>no</strong></span> information about <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. So they know only <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> points through which <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span>, an unknown polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> passes. They wish to reconstruct <span class="math inline">\(P(0)\)</span>. But by our discussion in the previous section, for each possible value <span class="math inline">\(P(0) = b\)</span>, there is a unique polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> that passes through the <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> points of the <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> officials as well as through <span class="math inline">\((0, b)\)</span>. Hence the secret could be any of the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> possible values <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,\ldots,q-1\}\)</span>, so the officials have — in a very precise sense — no information about <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Another way of saying this is that the information of the officials is consistent with <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> different value representations, one for each possible value of the secret, and thus the officials have no information<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> about <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Suppose you are in charge of setting up a secret sharing scheme, with secret <span class="math inline">\(s=1\)</span>, where you want to distribute <span class="math inline">\(n = 5\)</span> shares to <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> people such that any <span class="math inline">\(k = 3\)</span> or more people can figure out the secret, but two or fewer cannot. Let’s say we are working over <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{GF}(7)\)</span> (note that <span class="math inline">\(7&gt;s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(7&gt;n\)</span>) and you randomly choose the following polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(k-1 = 2\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(P(x) = 3x^2 + 5x + 1\)</span> (here, <span class="math inline">\(P(0) = 1 = s\)</span>, the secret). So you know everything there is to know about the secret and the polynomial, but what about the people that receive the shares? Well, the shares handed out are <span class="math inline">\(P(1) = 2\)</span> to the first official, <span class="math inline">\(P(2) = 2\)</span> to the second, <span class="math inline">\(P(3) = 1\)</span> to the third, <span class="math inline">\(P(4) = 6\)</span> to the fourth, and <span class="math inline">\(P(5) = 3\)</span> to the fifth official. Let’s say that officials <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> get together (we expect them to be able to recover the secret). Using Lagrange interpolation, they compute the following delta functions: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\Delta_3(x) &amp;= \frac{(x - 4)(x - 5)}{(3 - 4)(3 - 5)} = \frac{(x - 4)(x - 5)}{2} = 4(x-4)(x-5);\\
\Delta_4(x) &amp;= \frac{(x - 3)(x - 5)}{(4 - 3)(4 - 5)} = \frac{(x - 3)(x - 5)}{-1} = 6(x-3)(x-5);\\
\Delta_5(x) &amp;= \frac{(x - 3)(x - 4)}{(5 - 3)(5 - 4)} = \frac{(x - 3)(x - 4)}{2} = 4(x-3)(x-4).\end{aligned}\]</span> They then compute the polynomial over <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{GF}(7)\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(P(x) = (1)\Delta_3(x)+(6)\Delta_4(x)+(3)\Delta_5(x) = 3x^2+5x+1\)</span> (verify the computation!). Now they simply compute <span class="math inline">\(P(0)\)</span> and discover that the secret is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens if two officials try to get together, say persons <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. They both know that the polynomial looks like <span class="math inline">\(P(x) = a_2x^2 + a_1x + s\)</span>. They also know the following equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(1) &amp;= a_2 + a_1 + s = 2\\
P(5) &amp;= 4a_2 + 5a_1 + s = 3\end{aligned}\]</span> But that is all they have two equations with three unknowns, and thus they cannot find out the secret. This is the case no matter which two officials get together. Notice that since we are working over <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{GF}(7)\)</span>, the two people could have guessed the secret (<span class="math inline">\(0 \le s \le 6\)</span>) and constructed a unique degree 2 polynomial (by <a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a>). But the two people combined have the same chance of guessing what the secret is as they do individually. This is important, as it implies that two people have no more information about the secret than one person does.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Another linear-algebra based algorithm that is more computer friendly is given in the next note.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>However, the result of <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a> does hold for polynomials with integer or natural number coefficients with the domain restricted to integers or natural numbers. That is because we have proved something <span><em>stronger</em></span> by going to the rationals or reals. If a polynomial has no more than <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> real roots, it certainly has no more than <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> integer roots. After all, every integer is a real number!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a> does not hold at all if we restrict all the numbers involved to be integers. Try finding a straight line that goes through <span class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((2,1)\)</span>. It doesn’t have integer coefficients.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Again, it is useful to consider what happens if the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is not a prime. What happens to <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a>? Consider <span class="math inline">\(m=8\)</span> and the equation <span class="math inline">\(x^3 =  0\)</span>. How many roots? <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is a root for sure, but so are <span class="math inline">\(2,4,6\)</span>. That is <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> distinct roots to a third-degree polynomial. This means that <a href="#prop:prop1">Property 1</a> does not hold and neither does <a href="#prop:prop2">Property 2</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike in the case of the integers, we cannot simply embed the numbers mod <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> into a larger field for which the result holds. This goes to show that we must be careful. It turns out that there is a way construct a finite field with <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> elements, but it is not simply the integers mod <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Note that this is a good reason to work first over finite fields rather than, say, over the real numbers, where the basic secret-sharing scheme would still work in principle. Because there are only finitely many values in our field, we can quantify precisely how many remaining possibilities there are for the value of the secret, and show that this is the same as if the officials had no information at all. For the reals, it is much more subtle to try to quantify the idea of “no information” because certain infinities will arise.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
