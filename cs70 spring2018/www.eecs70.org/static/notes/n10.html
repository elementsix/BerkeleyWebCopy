<h2 id="cardinality" class="unnumbered">Cardinality</h2>
<p>How can we determine whether two sets have the same <span><em>cardinality</em></span> (or “size”)? The answer to this question, reassuringly, lies in early grade school memories: by demonstrating a <span><em>pairing</em></span> between elements of the two sets. More formally, we need to demonstrate a <span><em>bijection</em></span> <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> between the two sets. The bijection sets up a one-to-one correspondence, or pairing, between elements of the two sets. We know how this works for finite sets. In this lecture, we will see what it tells us about <span><em>infinite</em></span> sets.</p>
<p>Are there more natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> than there are positive integers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z^+}\)</span>? It is tempting to answer yes, since every positive integer is also a natural number, but the natural numbers have one extra element <span class="math inline">\(0 \notin \mathbb{Z^+}\)</span>. Upon more careful observation, though, we see that we can generate a mapping between the natural numbers and the positive integers as follows:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n10-bijection-1.png" style="width:50.0%" />

</div>
<p>Why is this mapping a bijection? Clearly, the function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z^+}\)</span> is onto because every positive integer is hit. And it is also one-to-one because no two natural numbers have the same image. (The image of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=n+1\)</span>, so if <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=f(m)\)</span> then we must have <span class="math inline">\(n=m\)</span>.) Since we have shown a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z^{+}}\)</span>, this tells us that there are as many natural numbers as there are positive integers! Informally, we have proved that “<span class="math inline">\(\infty + 1 = \infty\)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>What about the set of <span><em>even</em></span> natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(2\mathbb{N} = \{0,2,4,6,...\}\)</span>? In the previous example the difference was just one element. But in this example, there seem to be twice as many natural numbers as there are even natural numbers. Surely, the cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> must be larger than that of <span class="math inline">\(2\mathbb{N}\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> contains all of the odd natural numbers as well. Though it might seem to be a more difficult task, let us attempt to find a bijection between the two sets using the following mapping:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
{\mathbb{N}}&amp; &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; \cdots \\
&amp; &amp; \downarrow &amp; \downarrow &amp; \downarrow &amp; \downarrow &amp; \downarrow &amp; \downarrow \\
2{\mathbb{N}}&amp; &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 6 &amp; 8 &amp; 10 &amp; \cdots
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>The mapping in this example is also a bijection. <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is clearly one-to-one, since distinct natural numbers get mapped to distinct even natural numbers (because <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=2n\)</span>). <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is also onto, since every <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> in the range is hit: its pre-image is <span class="math inline">\(n/2\)</span>. Since we have found a bijection between these two sets, this tells us that in fact <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\mathbb{N}\)</span> have the same cardinality!</p>
<p>What about the set of all integers, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>? At first glance, it may seem obvious that the set of integers is larger than the set of natural numbers, since it includes negative numbers. However, as it turns out, it is possible to find a bijection between the two sets, meaning that the two sets have the same size! Consider the following mapping:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 \rightarrow 0, \; 1 \rightarrow -1, \; 2 \rightarrow 1, \;  3
\rightarrow -2, \;  4 \rightarrow 2, \; \dotsc, \; 124 \rightarrow 62, \; \dotsc\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, our function is defined as follows: <span class="math display">\[f(x) = \begin{cases} x/2 &amp; \text{if $x$ is even} \\
-(x+1)/2 &amp; \text{if $x$ is odd}
\end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>We will prove that this function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}\)</span> is a bijection, by first showing that it is one-to-one and then showing that it is onto.</p>
<p><strong>Proof (one-to-one):</strong> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = f(y)\)</span>. Then they both must have the same sign. Therefore either <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(y) = y/2\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = -(x+1)/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(y) = -(y+1)/2\)</span>. In the first case, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = f(y) \implies x/2 = y/2 \implies x =y\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(x=y\)</span>. In the second case, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = f(y) \implies -(x+1)/2 = -(y+1)/2 \implies x = y\)</span>. So in both cases <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=f(y) \implies x=y\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective.</p>
<p><strong>Proof (onto):</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(y\in\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is non-negative, then <span class="math inline">\(f(2y) = y\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> has a pre-image. If <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is negative, then <span class="math inline">\(f(-(2y+1)) = y\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> has a pre-image. Thus every <span class="math inline">\(y\in\mathbb{Z}\)</span> has a preimage, so <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is onto.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a bijection, this tells us that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> have the same size.</p>
<p>Now for an important definition. We say that a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is <span><strong>countable</strong></span> if there is a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> or some subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Thus any finite set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is countable (since there is a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and the subset <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,\ldots,m-1\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(m=|S|\)</span> is the size of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>). And we have already seen three examples of countable infinite sets: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z^+}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\mathbb{N}\)</span> are obviously countable since they are themselves subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>; and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is countable because we have just seen a bijection between it and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
<p>What about the set of all rational numbers? Recall that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q} = \{x/y \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z}, y \not= 0\}\)</span>. Surely there are more rational numbers than natural numbers? After all, there are infinitely many rational numbers between any two natural numbers. Surprisingly, the two sets have the same cardinality! To see this, let us introduce a slightly different way of comparing the cardinality of two sets.</p>
<p>If there is a one-to-one function <span class="math inline">\(f:A \rightarrow B\)</span>, then the cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is less than or equal to that of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Now to show that the cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are the same we can show that <span class="math inline">\(|A| \leq |B|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|B| \leq |A|\)</span>. This corresponds to showing that there is a one-to-one function <span class="math inline">\(f: A \rightarrow B\)</span> and a one-to-one function <span class="math inline">\(g: B \rightarrow A\)</span>. The existence of these two one-to-one functions implies that there is a bijection <span class="math inline">\(h: A \rightarrow B\)</span>, thus showing that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> have the same cardinality. The proof of this fact, which is called the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, is actually quite hard, and we will skip it here.</p>
<p>Back to comparing the natural numbers and the rationals. First it is obvious that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{N}|\le |\mathbb{Q}|\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\subseteq\mathbb{Q}\)</span>. So our goal now is to prove that also <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{Q}|\le|\mathbb{N}|\)</span>. To do this, we must exhibit an injection <span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{Q}\to\mathbb{N}\)</span>. The following picture of a spiral conveys the idea of this injection:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n10-spiral.png" style="width:30.0%" />

</div>
<p>Each rational number <span class="math inline">\(a/b\)</span> (written in its lowest terms, so that <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(a,b)=1\)</span>) is represented by the point <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> in the infinite two-dimensional grid shown (which corresponds to <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{Z}}\times{\mathbb{Z}}\)</span>, the set of all pairs of integers). Note that not all points on the grid are valid representations of rationals: e.g., all points on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis have <span class="math inline">\(b=0\)</span> so none are valid (except for <span class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span>, which we take to represent the rational number <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>); and points such as <span class="math inline">\((2,8)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((-1,-4)\)</span> are not valid either as the rational number <span class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span> is represented by <span class="math inline">\((1,4)\)</span>. But <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{Z}}\times {\mathbb{Z}}\)</span> certainly contains all rationals under this representation, so if we come up with an injection from <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{Z}}\times {\mathbb{Z}}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}\)</span> then this will also be an injection from <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{Q}}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}\)</span> (why?).</p>
<p>The idea is to map each pair <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> to its position along the spiral, starting at the origin. (Thus, e.g.,<span class="math inline">\((0,0)\rightarrow 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((1,0)\rightarrow 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((1,1)\rightarrow 2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((0,1)\rightarrow 3\)</span>, and so on.) This mapping certainly maps every rational number to a natural number, because every rational appears somewhere (exactly once) in the grid, and the spiral hits every point in the grid. Why is this mapping an injection? Well, we just have to check that no two rational numbers map to the same natural number. But that is true because no two pairs lie at the same position on the spiral. (Note that the mapping is <span><em>not</em></span> onto because some positions along the spiral do not correspond to valid representations of rationals; but that is fine.)</p>
<p>This tells us that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{Q}| \leq |\mathbb{N}|\)</span>. Since also <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{N}| \leq |\mathbb{Q}|\)</span>, as we observed earlier, by the Cantor-Bernstein Theorem <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> have the same cardinality.</p>
<p>Our next example concerns the set of all binary strings (of any finite length), denoted <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span>. Despite the fact that this set contains strings of unbounded length, it turns out to have the same cardinality as <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}\)</span>. To see this, we set up a direct bijection <span class="math inline">\(f:\{0,1\}^*\to{\mathbb{N}}\)</span> as follows. Note that it suffices to <span><em>enumerate</em></span> the elements of <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> in such a way that each string appears exactly once in the list. We then get our bijection by setting <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> to be the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th string in the list. How do we enumerate the strings in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span>? Well, it’s natural to list them in increasing order of length, and then (say) in <span><em>lexicographic</em></span> order (or, equivalently, numerically increasing order when viewed as binary numbers) within the strings of each length. This means that the list would look like <span class="math display">\[\varepsilon,0,1,00,01,10,11,000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111,1000,\ldots,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> denotes the empty string (the only string of length <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>). It should be clear that this list contains each binary string once and only once, so we get a bijection with <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}\)</span> as desired.</p>
<p>Our final countable example is the set of all polynomials with natural number coefficients, which we denote <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}[x]\)</span>. To see that this set is countable, we will make use of (a variant of) the previous example. Note first that, by essentially the same argument as for <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span>, we can see that the set of all <span><em>ternary</em></span> strings <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2\}^*\)</span> (that is, strings over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2\}\)</span>) is countable. To see that <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}[x]\)</span> is countable, it therefore suffices to exhibit an injection <span class="math inline">\(f:{\mathbb{N}}[x]\to\{0,1,2\}^*\)</span>, which in turn will give an injection from <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}[x]\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}\)</span>. (It is obvious that there exists an injection from <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}[x]\)</span>, since each natural number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is itself trivially a polynomial, namely the constant polynomial <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> itself.)</p>
<p>How do we define <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>? Let’s first consider an example, namely the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = 5x^5 + 2x^4 + 7x^3 + 4x + 6\)</span>. We can list the coefficients of <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> as follows: <span class="math inline">\((5,2,7,0,4,6)\)</span>. We can then write these coefficients as binary strings: <span class="math inline">\((101_2,10_2,111_2,0_2,100_2,110_2)\)</span>. Now, we can construct a ternary string where a “<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>&quot; is inserted as a separator between each binary coefficient (ignoring coefficients that are <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>). Thus we map <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> to a ternary string as illustrated below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{c}
5x^5 + 2x^4 + 7x^3 + 4x + 6 \\
\downarrow \\
\boxed{101} 2 \boxed{10} 2 \boxed{111} 22 \boxed{100} 2 \boxed{110}
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>It is easy to check that this is an injection, since the original polynomial can be uniquely recovered from this ternary string by simply reading off the coefficients between each successive pair of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>’s. (Notice that this mapping <span class="math inline">\(f:{\mathbb{N}}[x]\to\{0,1,2\}^*\)</span> is not onto (and hence not a bijection) since many ternary strings will not be the image of any polynomials; this will be the case, for example, for any ternary strings that contain binary subsequences with leading zeros.)</p>
<p>Hence we have an injection from <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}[x]\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}[x]\)</span> is countable.</p>
<h2 id="cantors-diagonalization" class="unnumbered">Cantor’s Diagonalization</h2>
<p>So we have established that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> all have the same cardinality. What about the real numbers, the set of all points on the real line? Surely they are countable too? After all, the rational numbers, like the real numbers, are dense (i.e., between any two rational numbers there is a rational number):</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n10-rationals.png" style="width:20.0%" />

</div>
<p>In fact, between any two <span><em>real</em></span> numbers there is always a rational number. It is really surprising, then, that there are more real numbers than rationals. That is, there is no bijection between the rationals (or the natural numbers) and the reals. In fact, we will show something even stronger: even the real numbers in the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> are uncountable!</p>
<p>Recall that a real number can be written out in an infinite decimal expansion. A real number in the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(0.d_1 d_2 d_3 \dotsc\)</span> Note that this representation is not unique; for example, <span class="math inline">\(1 = 0.999 \dotsc\)</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>; for definiteness we shall assume that every real number is represented as a recurring decimal where possible (i.e., we choose the representation <span class="math inline">\(.999\ldots\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>).</p>
<p><strong>Cantor’s Diagonalization Proof:</strong> Suppose towards a contradiction that there is a bijection <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}[0,1]\)</span>. Then, we can enumerate the infinite list as follows:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n10-cantor.png" style="width:30.0%" />

</div>
<p>The number circled in the diagonal is some real number <span class="math inline">\(D=0.5479\ldots\)</span>, since it is an infinite decimal expansion. Now consider the real number <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> obtained by modifying every digit of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, say by replacing each digit <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(d + 2 \bmod 10\)</span>; thus in our example above, <span class="math inline">\(s=0.7691\ldots\)</span>. We claim that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> does not occur in our infinite list of real numbers. Suppose for contradiction that it did as the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> number in the list. But the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> number’s <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> digit is the same as the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> digit of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and thus is different from the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> digit of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>: the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> digit of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> digit of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> plus <span class="math inline">\(2 \bmod 10\)</span>. So we have a real number <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> that is not in the range of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. But this contradicts the assertion that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a bijection. Thus the real numbers are not countable.</p>
<p>Let us remark that the reason that we modified each digit by adding <span class="math inline">\(2 \bmod 10\)</span> as opposed to adding <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is that the same real number can have two decimal expansions; for example <span class="math inline">\(0.999 \dotsc = 1.000 \dotsc\)</span>. But if two real numbers differ by more than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in any digit they cannot be equal. Thus we are completely safe in our assertion.</p>
<p>With Cantor’s diagonalization method, we proved that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is uncountable. What happens if we apply the same method to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, in a (futile) attempt to show the rationals are uncountable? Well, suppose for a contradiction that our bijective function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q} [0,1]\)</span> produces the following mapping:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n10-cantor-3.png" style="width:30.0%" />

</div>
<p>This time, let us consider the number <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> obtained by modifying every digit of the diagonal, say by replacing each digit <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(d+2 \bmod 10\)</span>. Then in the above example <span class="math inline">\(q = 0.316 \dotsc\)</span>, and we want to try to show that it does not occur in our infinite list of rational numbers. However, we do not know if <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is rational (in fact, it is extremely unlikely for the decimal expansion of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> to be periodic). This is why the method fails when applied to the rationals. When dealing with the reals, the modified diagonal number was guaranteed to be a real number.</p>
<h2 id="the-cantor-set" class="unnumbered">The Cantor Set</h2>
<p><em>Please read on only if interested.</em></p>
<p>The Cantor set is a remarkable set construction involving the real numbers in the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. The set is defined by repeatedly removing the middle thirds of line segments infinitely many times, starting with the original interval. For example, the first iteration would involve the removal of the interval <span class="math inline">\((1/3, 2/3)\)</span>, leaving <span class="math inline">\([0,1/3] \cup [2/3,1]\)</span>. The first three iterations are illustrated below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n10-cantor-set.png" style="width:50.0%" />

</div>
<p>The Cantor set contains all points that have <span><em>not</em></span> been removed: <span class="math inline">\(C = \{x : x \text{ not thrown out}\}\)</span>. How much of the original unit interval is left after this process is repeated infinitely? Well, we start with 1, and after the first iteration we remove <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span> of the interval, leaving us with <span class="math inline">\(2/3\)</span>. For the second iteration, we keep <span class="math inline">\((2/3) \cdot (2/3)\)</span> of the original interval. As we repeat the iterations infinitely, we are left with:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1 \longrightarrow \frac{2}{3} \longrightarrow \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \longrightarrow \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow \lim_{n \to \infty } \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n = 0\]</span></p>
<p>According to the calculations, we have removed everything from the original interval! Does this mean that the Cantor set is empty? No, it doesn’t. What it means is that the <span><em>measure</em></span> of the Cantor set is zero; the Cantor set consists of isolated points and does not contain any non-trivial intervals. In fact, not only is the Cantor set non-empty, it is uncountable!<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>To see why, let us first make a few observations about ternary strings. In ternary notation, all strings consist of digits (called “trits&quot;) from the set <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2\}\)</span>. All real numbers in the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> can be written in ternary notation. (E.g., <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span>, or equivalently as <span class="math inline">\(0.0222\ldots\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(2/3\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(0.2\)</span> or as <span class="math inline">\(0.1222\ldots\)</span>.) Thus, in the first iteration, the middle third removed contains all ternary numbers of the form <span class="math inline">\(0.1xxxxx\dotsc\)</span>. The ternary numbers left after the first removal can all be expressed either in the form <span class="math inline">\(0.0xxxxx\dotsc\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(0.2xxxxx\dotsc\)</span>. (We have to be a little careful here with the endpoints of the intervals; but we can handle them by writing <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(0.02222\ldots\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2/3\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(0.2\)</span>.) The second iteration removes ternary numbers of the form <span class="math inline">\(0.01xxxxx\dotsc\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0.21xxxxx\dotsc\)</span> (i.e., any number with <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in the second position). The third iteration removes <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>’s in the third position, and so on. Therefore, what remains is all ternary numbers with only <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>’s. Thus we have shown that <span class="math display">\[C = \{x\in[0,1]:x \text{ has a ternary representation consisting only of $0$&#39;s and $2$&#39;s}\}.\]</span> Finally, using this characterization, we can set up an <span><em>onto</em></span> map <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. Since we already know that <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> is uncountable, this implies that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is uncountable also. The map <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is defined as follows: for <span class="math inline">\(x\in C\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is defined as the binary decimal obtained by dividing each digit of the ternary representation of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> by 2. Thus, for example, if <span class="math inline">\(x = 0.0220\)</span> (in ternary), then <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is the binary decimal <span class="math inline">\(0.0110\)</span>). But the set of all binary decimals <span class="math inline">\(0.xxxxx\ldots\)</span> is in one-to-one correspondence with the real interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>, and the map <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is onto because every binary decimal is the image of some ternary string under <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (obtained by doubling every binary digit).<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This completes the proof that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is uncountable.</p>
<h2 id="power-sets-and-higher-orders-of-infinity-optional" class="unnumbered">Power Sets and Higher Orders of Infinity (Optional)</h2>
<p><em>Please read on only if interested.</em></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be any set. Then the <span><em>power set</em></span> of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(S)\)</span>, is the set of all subsets of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. More formally, it is defined as: <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(S) = \{T : T \subseteq S\}\)</span>. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(S = \{1,2,3\}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(S) = \{\{\},\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\}\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>What is the cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(S)\)</span>? If <span class="math inline">\(|S|=k\)</span> is finite, then <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2^k\)</span>. To see this, let us think of each subset of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> corresponding to a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> bit string. In the example above the subset <span class="math inline">\(\{1,3\}\)</span> corresponds to the string <span class="math inline">\(101\)</span>. A <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(i^{\text{th}}\)</span> position indicates that the <span class="math inline">\(i^{\text{th}}\)</span> element of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is in the subset and a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> indicates that it is not. Now the number of binary strings of length <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(2^k\)</span>, since there are two choices for each bit position. Thus <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2^{k}\)</span>. So for finite sets <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, the cardinality of the power set of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is exponentially larger than the cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. What about infinite (countable) sets? We claim that there is no bijection from <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(S)\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(S)\)</span> is not countable. Thus for example the set of all subsets of natural numbers is not countable, even though the set of natural numbers itself is countable.</p>
<p><span id="theorem:1" class="pandoc-numbering-text theorem"><strong>Theorem 1</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be countably infinite. Then <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{P}(S)| &gt; |S|\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Proof</em>. Suppose towards a contradiction that there is a bijection <span class="math inline">\(f: S \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(S)\)</span>. Recall that we can represent a subset by a binary string, with one bit for each element of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. (So, since <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is infinite, the string will be infinitely long. Contrast the case of <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> discussed earlier, which consists of all binary strings of <span><em>finite</em></span> length.) Consider the following diagonalization picture in which the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> maps natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to binary strings which correspond to subsets of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(2 \rightarrow 10100\ldots = \{0,2\}\)</span>):</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n10-cantor-2.png" style="width:20.0%" />

</div>
<p>In this case, we have assigned the following mapping: <span class="math inline">\(0 \rightarrow \{0\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1 \rightarrow \{\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2 \rightarrow \{0,2\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span> (i.e., the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> row describes the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> subset as follows: if there is a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(k^{\text{th}}\)</span> column, then <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is in this subset, else it is not.) Using a similar diagonalization argument to the earlier one, flip each bit along the diagonal: <span class="math inline">\(1 \rightarrow 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0 \rightarrow 1\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> denote the resulting binary string. First, we must show that the new element is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Clearly it is, since <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is an infinite binary string which corresponds to a subset of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Now suppose <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> were the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> binary string. This cannot be the case though, since the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> bit of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> differs from the <span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> bit of the diagonal (the bits are flipped). So it’s not on our list, but it should be, since we assumed that the list enumerated all possible subsets of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Thus we have a contradiction, implying that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(S)\)</span> is uncountable. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>Thus we have seen that the cardinality of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}({\mathbb{N}})\)</span> (the power set of the natural numbers) is strictly larger than the cardinality of <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}\)</span> itself. The cardinality of <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{N}}\)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_0\)</span> (pronounced “aleph null&quot;), while that of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}({\mathbb{N}})\)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\(2^{\aleph_0}\)</span>. It turns out that in fact <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}({\mathbb{N}})\)</span> has the same cardinality as <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{R}}\)</span> (the real numbers), and indeed as the real numbers in <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. This cardinality is known as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{c}\)</span>, the “cardinality of the continuum.&quot; So we know that <span class="math inline">\(2^{\aleph_0}=\mathbf{c} &gt; \aleph_0\)</span>. Even larger infinite cardinalities (or “orders of infinity&quot;), denoted <span class="math inline">\(\aleph_1,\aleph_2,\ldots\)</span>, can be defined using the machinery of set theory; these obey (to the uninitiated somewhat bizarre) rules of arithmetic. Several fundamental questions in modern mathematics concern these objects. For example, the famous “continuum hypothesis&quot; asserts that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{c}=\aleph_1\)</span> (which is equivalent to saying that there are no sets with cardinality between that of the natural numbers and that of the real numbers).</p>

Hence <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> has the same cardinality as <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> (and as <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{R}}\)</span>).<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
