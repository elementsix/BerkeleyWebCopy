<h1 id="scn:intro">Graph Theory: An Introduction</h1>
<p>One of the fundamental ideas in computer science is the notion of <em>abstraction</em>: capturing the essence or the core of some complex situation by a simple model. Some of the largest and most complex entities we might deal with include the internet, the brain, maps, and social networks. In each case, there is an underlying “network” or <em>graph</em> that captures the important features that help us understand these entities more deeply. In the case of the internet, this network or graph specifies how web pages link to one another. In the case of the brain, it is the interconnection network between neurons. We can describe these ideas in the beautiful framework of <em>graph theory</em>, which is the subject of this lecture.</p>
<p>Remarkably, graph theory has its origins in a simple evening pastime of the residents of Königsberg, Prussia (nowadays Kaliningrad, Russia) a few centuries ago. Through their city ran the Pregel river, depicted on the left in Figure <a href="#fig:map">1</a> below, separating Königsberg into two banks <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and islands <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Connecting the islands to the mainland were seven bridges. As the residents of the city took their evening walks, many would try to solve the challenge of picking a route that would cross each of the seven bridges precisely once and return to the starting point.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n5-bridges.png" alt="Figure 1: (Left) The city of Königsberg. (Right) The (multi-)graph modeling the bridge connections in Königsberg." id="fig:map" style="width:40.0%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 1: (Left) The city of Königsberg. (Right) The (multi-)graph modeling the bridge connections in Königsberg.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1736, the brilliant mathematician Leonhard Euler proved this task to be impossible. How did he do it? The key is to realize that for the purpose of choosing such a route, Figure <a href="#fig:map">1</a> (Left) can be replaced with Figure <a href="#fig:map">1</a> (Right), where each land mass <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is replaced by a small circle, and each bridge by a line segment. With this abstraction in place, the task of choosing a route can be restated as follows: trace through all the line segments and return to the starting point without lifting the pen, and without traversing any line segment more than once. The proof of impossibility is simple. Under these tracing rules, the pen must enter each small circle as many times as it exits it, and therefore the number of line segments incident to that circle must be even. But in Figure <a href="#fig:map">1</a> (Right), each circle has an odd number of line segments incident to it, so it is impossible to carry out such a tracing. Actually Euler did more. He gave a precise condition under which the tracing can be carried out. For this reason, Euler is generally hailed as the inventor of graph theory.</p>
<h2 id="formal-definitions">Formal Definitions</h2>
<p>Formally, a (undirected) graph is defined by a set of vertices <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and a set of edges <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. The vertices correspond to the little circles in Figure <a href="#fig:map">1</a> above, and the edges correspond to the line segments between the vertices. In Figure <a href="#fig:map">1</a>, <span class="math inline">\(V = \{A, B, C, D\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E= \{\{A,B\}, \{A,B\}, \{A,C\}, \{B,C\}, \{B,D\}, \{B,D\}, \{C,D\} \}\)</span>. However, note that here <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is a multiset (a set where an element can appear multiple times). This is because in the Königsberg example there are multiple bridges between a pair of banks. We will generally not consider such a situation of multiple edges between a single pair of vertices, so in our definition, we require <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> to be a set, not a multi-set. What this means is that between any pair of vertices there is either <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> edge. If there are multiple edges between a pair of vertices, then we collapse them into a single edge.</p>
<p>More generally, we can also define a directed graph. If an edge in an undirected graph represents a street, then an edge in a directed graph represents a one-way street. To make this formal, let <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> be a set denoting the vertices of a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. For example, we can have <span class="math inline">\(V={\{1,2,3,4\}}\)</span>. Then, the set of (directed) edges <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(V\times V\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(E\subseteq V\times V\)</span>. (Recall here that <span class="math inline">\(U\times V\)</span> denotes the Cartesian product of sets <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, defined as <span class="math inline">\(U \times V = \{(u,v): u \in U \text{ and } v \in V\}\)</span>.) Continuing with our example, let <span class="math inline">\(E={\{(1,2),(1,3),(1,4)\}}\)</span>. Then, the corresponding graph is given by <span class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n5-graph-1.png" alt="Examples of directed and undirected graphs, respectively." style="width:70.0%" />
<p class="caption">Examples of directed and undirected graphs, respectively.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that each edge in <span class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> has a <em>direction</em> specified by an arrow; thus, for example, <span class="math inline">\((1,2)\in E\)</span> but <span class="math inline">\((2,1)\not\in E\)</span>. Such graphs are useful in modeling one-way relationships, such as one-way streets between two locations, and are called <em>directed</em>. On the other hand, if each edge goes in both directions, i.e., <span class="math inline">\((u,v)\in E\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\((v,u)\in E\)</span>, then we call the graph <em>undirected</em>. For undirected graphs we drop the ordered pair notation for edges, and simply denote the edge between <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> by the set <span class="math inline">\(\{u,v\}\)</span>. Undirected graphs model relationships such as two-way streets between locations naturally, and an example is given by <span class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span> above. For simplicity, we omit the arrowheads when drawing edges in undirected graphs. We conclude that a graph is thus formally specified as an ordered pair <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the vertex set and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the edge set.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sanity check!</em> What are the vertex and edge sets <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> for graph <span class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us continue our discussion with a working example from <em>social networks</em>, an area in which graph theory plays a fundamental role. Suppose you wish to model a social network in which vertices correspond to people, and edges correspond to the following relationship between people: We say Alex <em>recognizes</em> Bridget if Alex knows who Bridget is, but Bridget does not know who Alex is. If, on the other hand, Alex knows Bridget and Bridget knows Alex, then we say they <em>know each other</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sanity check!</em> Suppose first that an edge between two people (say) Alex and Bridget means that Alex recognizes Bridget; would you use a directed or undirected graph for this? How about if an edge instead means Alex and Bridget know each other? (Answer: directed and undirected, respectively.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving on with our example, we say that edge <span class="math inline">\(e = \{u,v\}\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(e=(u,v)\)</span>) is <span><em>incident</em></span> on vertices <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, and that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> are <span><em>neighbors</em></span> or <span><em>adjacent</em></span>. If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is undirected, then the <span><em>degree</em></span> of vertex <span class="math inline">\(u \in V\)</span> is the number of edges incident to <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(degree(u)=|\{v \in V: \{u,v\} \in E\}|\)</span>. A vertex <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> whose degree is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is called an <span><em>isolated</em></span> vertex, since there is no edge which connects <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to the rest of the graph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sanity check!</em> What does the degree of a vertex represent in our <em>undirected</em> social network in which an edge <span class="math inline">\(\{u, v\}\)</span> means <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> know each other? How should we interpret an isolated vertex?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A directed graph, on the other hand, has two different notions of degree due to the directions on the edges. Specifically, the <span><em>in-degree</em></span> of a vertex <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the number of edges from other vertices to <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, and the <span><em>out-degree</em></span> of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the number of edges from <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to other vertices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sanity check!</em> What do the in-degree and out-degree of a vertex represent in our <em>directed</em> social network in which an edge <span class="math inline">\((u, v)\)</span> means <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> recognizes <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, our definition of a graph thus far allows edges of the form <span class="math inline">\(\{u,u\}\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\((u,u)\)</span>), i.e., a <span><em>self-loop</em></span>. In our social network, however, this gives us no interesting information (it means that person <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> recognizes him/herself!). Thus, here and in general in these notes, we shall assume that our graphs have no self-loops, unless stated otherwise. We shall also not allow multiple edges between a pair of vertices (unlike the case of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg).</p>
<h4 id="paths-walks-and-cycles">Paths, Walks, and Cycles</h4>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> be an undirected graph. A <span><em>path</em></span> in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a sequence of edges <span class="math display">\[\{v_1,v_2\},\{v_2,v_3\},...,\{v_{n-2},v_{n-1}\},\{v_{n-1},v_n\}.\]</span> In this case we say that there is a path <span><em>between <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_n\)</span></em></span>. For example, suppose the graph <span class="math inline">\(G_3\)</span> below models a residential neighborhood in which each vertex corresponds to a house, and two houses <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> are neighbors if there exists a direct road from <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>

<p><em>Sanity check!</em> What is the shortest path from house <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to house <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(G_3\)</span>? How about the longest path, assuming no house is visited twice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually, we assume a path is <span><em>simple</em></span>, meaning <span class="math inline">\(v_1,\ldots,v_n\)</span> are distinct. This makes complete sense in our housing example <span class="math inline">\(G_3\)</span>; if you wanted drive from house <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> via house <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, why would you visit house <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> more than once? A <span><em>cycle</em></span> (or <span><em>circuit</em></span>) is a sequence of edges <span class="math inline">\(\{v_1,v_2\},\{v_2,v_3\},\ldots,\{v_{n-2},v_{n-1}\},\{v_{n-1},v_n\},\{v_n,v_1\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(v_1,\ldots,v_n\)</span> are distinct (i.e., a cycle is a path which starts and ends on the same vertex <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span>).</p>

A sequence of edges with repeated vertices, such as this one, is called a <em>walk</em> from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Analogous to the relationship between paths and cycles, a <span><em>tour</em></span> is a walk which starts and ends at the same vertex. For example, <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\},\{2,3\}, \{3,1\}\)</span> is a tour.</p>
<h4 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h4>
<p>Much of what we discuss in this note revolves around the notion of connectivity. A graph is said to be <span><em>connected</em></span> if there is a path between any two distinct vertices. For example, our residential network <span class="math inline">\(G_3\)</span> above is connected, since one can drive from any house to any other house via <em>some</em> sequence of direct roads. On the other hand, the network below is <em>disconnected</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sanity check!</em> What would a disconnected vertex represent in our residential network? Why would you not want to design a neighborhood this way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that <em>any</em> graph (even a disconnected one) always consists of a collection of <em>connected components</em>, i.e., sets <span class="math inline">\(V_1,\dots,V_k\)</span> of vertices, such that all vertices in a set <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> are connected. For example, the graph above is not connected, but nevertheless consists of three connected components: <span class="math inline">\(V_1={\{1,2,3\}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_2={\{4\}}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(V_3={\{5,6,7\}}\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="scn:euler">Revisiting the Seven Bridges of Königsberg: Eulerian Tours</h1>
<p>With a formal underpinning in graph theory under our belts, we are ready to revisit the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. What exactly is this problem asking? It says: Given a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> (in this case, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is an abstraction of Königsberg), is there a walk in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that uses each edge exactly once? We call any such walk in a graph an <em>Eulerian walk</em>. (In contrast, by definition a walk can normally visit each edge or vertex as many times as desired.) Moreover, if an Eulerian walk is closed, i.e., it ends at its starting point, then it is called an <span><em>Eulerian tour</em></span>. Thus, the Seven Bridges of Königsberg asks: Given a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, does it have an Eulerian tour? We now give a precise characterization of this in terms of simpler properties of the graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. For this, define an <em>even degree</em> graph as a graph in which all vertices have even degree.</p>
<p><span id="thm:euler" class="pandoc-numbering-text thm"><strong>Theorem 1</strong> <em>(Euler's Theorem (1736))</em></span></p>
<p><em>An undirected graph <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> has an Eulerian tour iff <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is even degree, and connected (except possibly for isolated vertices).</em></p>
<p><em>Proof</em>. To prove this, we must establish two directions: if, and only if.</p>
<p><em>Only if.</em> We give a direct proof for the forward direction, i.e., if <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has an Eulerian tour, then it is connected and has even degree. Assume that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has an Eulerian tour. This means every vertex that has an edge adjacent to it (i.e., every non-isolated vertex) must lie on the tour, and is therefore connected with all other vertices on the tour. This proves that the graph is connected (except for isolated vertices).</p>
<p>Next, we prove that each vertex has even degree by showing that all edges incident to a vertex can be paired up. Notice that every time the tour enters a vertex along an edge it exits along a different edge. We can pair these two edges up (they are never again traversed in the tour). The only exception is the start vertex, where the first edge leaving it cannot be paired in this way. But notice that by definition, the tour necessarily ends at the start vertex. Therefore, we can pair the first edge with the last edge entering the start vertex. So all edges adjacent to any vertex of the tour can be paired up, and therefore each vertex has even degree.</p>
<p><em>If.</em> We give a recursive algorithm for finding an Eulerian tour, and prove by induction that it correctly outputs an Eulerian tour.</p>
<p>We start with a useful subroutine, <code>FindTour(G, s)</code>, which finds a tour (not necessarily Eulerian) in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. <code>FindTour</code> is very simple: it just starts walking from a vertex <span class="math inline">\(s \in V\)</span>, at each step choosing any untraversed edge incident to the current vertex, until it gets stuck because there is no more adjacent untraversed edge. We now prove that <code>FindTour</code> must in fact get stuck at the original vertex <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Claim:</strong></span> <code>FindTour(G, s)</code> must get stuck at <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Proof of Claim:</em></span> An easy proof by induction on the length of the walk shows that when <code>FindTour</code> enters any vertex <span class="math inline">\(v \neq s\)</span>, it will have traversed an odd number of edges incident to <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, while when it enters <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> it will have traversed an even number of edges incident to <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Since every vertex in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has even degree, this means every time it enters <span class="math inline">\(v \neq s\)</span>, there is at least one untraversed edge incident to <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, and therefore the walk cannot get stuck. So the only vertex it can get stuck at is <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. The formal proof is left as an exercise. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>The algorithm <code>FindTour(G, s)</code> returns the tour it has traveled when it gets stuck at <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Note that while <code>FindTour(G, s)</code> always succeeds in finding a tour, it does not always return an Eulerian tour.</p>
<p>We now give a recursive algorithm <code>Euler(G, s)</code> that outputs an Eulerian tour starting and ending at <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. <code>Euler(G, s)</code> invokes another subroutine <code>Splice(T, T_1, ..., T_k)</code> which takes as input a number of edge disjoint tours <span class="math inline">\(T, T_1,\dots,T_k\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(k \ge 1\)</span>), with the condition that the tour <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> intersects each of the tours <span class="math inline">\(T_1, \ldots, T_k\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> shares a vertex with each of the <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span>’s). The procedure <code>Splice(T, T_1, ..., T_k)</code> outputs a single tour <span class="math inline">\(T&#39;\)</span> that traverses all the edges in <span class="math inline">\(T, T_1,\dots,T_k\)</span>, i.e., it splices together all the tours. The combined tour <span class="math inline">\(T&#39;\)</span> is obtained by traversing the edges of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and whenever it reaches a vertex <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> that intersects another tour <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span>, it takes a detour to traverse <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> back to <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> again, and only then it continues traversing <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>The algorithm <code>Euler(G, s)</code> is given as follows:</p>
<pre><code>function Euler(G, s)
  T = FindTour(G, s)
  Let G_1, ..., G_k be the connected components when the edges in T are removed from G,
    and let s_i be the first vertex in T that intersects G_i
  Output Splice(T, Euler(G_1, s_1), ..., Euler(G_k, s_k))
end Euler</code></pre>
<p>We prove by induction on the size of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that <code>Euler(G, s)</code> outputs an Eulerian Tour in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. The same proof works regardless of whether we think of size as number of vertices or number of edges. For concreteness, here we use number of edges <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>Base Case: <span class="math inline">\(m = 0\)</span>, which means <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is empty (it has no edges), so there is no tour to find.</p>
<p>Induction Hypothesis: <code>Euler(G, s)</code> outputs an Eulerian Tour in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> for any even degree, connected graph with at most <span class="math inline">\(m \ge 0\)</span> edges.</p>
<p>Induction Step: Suppose <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(m+1\)</span> edges. Recall that <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, the output of <code>FindTour(G, s)</code>, is a tour, and therefore has even degree at every vertex. When we remove the edges of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, we are therefore left with an even degree graph with less than <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> edges, but it might be disconnected. Let <span class="math inline">\(G_1, \ldots, G_k\)</span> be the connected components. Each such connected component has even degree and is connected (up to isolated vertices). Moreover, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> intersects each of the <span class="math inline">\(G_i\)</span>, and as we traverse <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> there is a first vertex where it intersects <span class="math inline">\(G_i\)</span>. Call it <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span>. By the induction hypothesis <code>Euler(G_i, s)</code> outputs an Eulerian tour of <span class="math inline">\(G_i\)</span>. Now by the definition of <code>Splice</code>, it splices the individual tours together into one large tour whose union is all the edges of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, hence an Eulerian tour. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>

<h2 id="trees" class="unnumbered">Trees</h2>
<p>We need to discuss trees briefly here, though we will discuss them more later. A graph is a <span><em>tree</em></span> if it is connected and acyclic (contains no cycles). There are many other equivalent definitions. For example, a tree is a connected graph where the number of vertices is one more than the number of edges. Or, a tree is a connected graph such that if you delete any edge it becomes disconnected.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<h2 id="planar-graphs" class="unnumbered">Planar Graphs</h2>
<p>A graph is <span><em>planar</em></span> if it can be drawn on the plane without crossings. For example, the first four graphs shown below are planar. Notice that the first and second graphs are the same, but drawn differently. Even though the second drawing has crossings, the graph is still considered planar since it is possible to draw it without crossings.</p>
<p>The other three graphs are not planar. The first one of them is the infamous “three houses-three wells graph,” also called <span class="math inline">\(K_{3,3}\)</span>. The second is the complete graph with five nodes, or <span class="math inline">\(K_5\)</span>. The third is the four-dimensional cube. We shall soon see how to prove that all three graphs are non-planar.</p>

</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n5-graphs-1.jpg" style="width:70.0%" />

</div>
<p>When a planar graph is drawn on the plane, one can distinguish, besides its vertices (their number will be denoted <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> here) and edges (their number is <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>), the <span><em>faces</em></span> of the graph (more precisely, of the drawing). The faces are the regions into which the graph subdivides the plane. One of them is infinite, and the others are finite. The number of faces is denoted <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. For example, for the first graph shown <span class="math inline">\(f=4\)</span>, and for the fourth (the cube) <span class="math inline">\(f=6\)</span>.</p>
<p>One basic and important fact about planar graphs is <span><em>Euler’s formula</em></span>, <span class="math inline">\(v+f=e+2\)</span> (check it for the graphs above). It has an interesting story. The ancient Greeks knew that this formula held for all polyhedra (check it for the cube, the tetrahedron, and the octahedron, for example), but could not prove it. How do you do induction on polyhedra? How do you apply the induction hypothesis? What is a polyhedron minus a vertex, or an edge? In the 18th century Euler realized that this is an instance of the inability to prove a theorem by induction <span><em>because it is too weak</em></span>, something that we saw time and again when we were studying induction. To prove the theorem, one has to generalize polyhedra. And the right generalization is <span><em>planar graphs</em></span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Can you see why planar graphs generalize polyhedra? Why are all polyhedra (without “holes”) planar graphs?</em></span></p>
<p><span id="thm:euler-formula" class="pandoc-numbering-text thm"><strong>Theorem 2</strong> <em>(Euler’s Formula)</em></span></p>
<p><em>For every connected planar graph, <span class="math inline">\(v+f=e+2\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Proof</em>. By induction on <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. It certainly holds when <span class="math inline">\(e=0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(v=f=1\)</span>. Now take any connected planar graph. Two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If it is a tree, then <span class="math inline">\(f=1\)</span> (drawing a tree on the plane does not subdivide the plane), and <span class="math inline">\(e=v-1\)</span> (check homework).</p></li>
<li><p>If it is not a tree, find a cycle and delete any edge of the cycle. This amounts to reducing both <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> by one. By induction the formula is true in the smaller graph, and so it must be true in the original one. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><em>What happens when the graph is not connected? How does the number of connected components enter the formula?</em></span></p>
<p>Take a planar graph with <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> faces, and consider one face. It has a number of <span><em>sides</em></span>, that is, edges that bound it clockwise. Note that an edge may be counted twice, if it has the same face on both sides, as it happens for example in a tree (such edges are called bridges). Denote by <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> the number of sides of face <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Now, if we add the <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span>’s we are going to get <span class="math inline">\(2e\)</span>, because each edge is counted twice, once for the face on its right and once for the face on its left (they may coincide if the edge is a bridge). We conclude that, in any planar graph, <a name="eq:1"></a><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 100%"><span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^f s_i =2e.\]</span><span style="position: absolute; right: 0em; top: 50%; line-height:0; text-align: right">(1)</span></span>  Now notice that, since we don’t allow parallel edges between the same two nodes, and if we assume that there are at least two edges (so there are at least three vertices), every face has at least three sides, or <span class="math inline">\(s_i\geq 3\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. It follows that <span class="math inline">\(3f\leq 2e\)</span>. Solving for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and plugging into Euler’s formula we get <span class="math display">\[e\leq 3v -6.\]</span></p>
<p>This is an important fact. First it tells us that planar graphs are <span><em>sparse</em></span>, they cannot have too many edges. A <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span>-vertex connected graph can have anywhere between a thousand and half a million edges. This inequality tells us that for planar graphs the range is very small, between <span class="math inline">\(999\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2994\)</span>.</p>
<p>It also tells us that <span class="math inline">\(K_5\)</span> is not planar: Just notice that it has five vertices and ten edges.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(v=6,e=9\)</span> so it passes the planarity test with flying colors. We must think a little harder to show that <span class="math inline">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> is non-planar. Notice that, if we had drawn it on the plane, there would be no triangles. Because a triangle means that two wells or two houses are connected together, which is false. So, Equation <a href="#eq:1">1</a> now gives us <span class="math inline">\(4f\leq 2e\)</span>, and solving for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and plugging into Euler’s formula, <span class="math inline">\(e\leq 2v-4\)</span>, which shows that <span class="math inline">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> is non-planar.</p>
<p>So, we have established that <span class="math inline">\(K_5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> are both non-planar. There is something deeper going on: In some sense, these are <span><em>the only non-planar graphs</em></span>. This is made precise in the following famous result, due to the Polish mathematician Kuratowski (this is what “<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>” stands for).</p>
<p><span id="thm:kuratowski" class="pandoc-numbering-text thm"><strong>Theorem 3</strong></span></p>
<p><em>A graph is non-planar if and only if it contains <span class="math inline">\(K_5\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(K_{3,3}\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>“Contains” here means that one can identify nodes in the graph (five in the case of <span class="math inline">\(K_5\)</span>, six in the case of <span class="math inline">\(K_{3,3}\)</span>) which are connected as the corresponding graph through paths (possibly single edges), and such that no two of these paths share no vertex. For example, the 4-cube shown below is non-planar, because it contains <span class="math inline">\(K_{3,3}\)</span>, as shown.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n5-nonplanar.png" style="width:60.0%" />

</div>
<p><span><em>Can you find <span class="math inline">\(K_5\)</span> in the same graph?</em></span></p>
<p>One direction of Kuratowski’s theorem is obvious: If a graph contains one of these two non-planar graphs, then of course it is itself non-planar. The other direction, namely that in the absence of these graphs we can draw any graph on the plane, is difficult. For a short proof you may want to type “proof of Kuratowski’s theorem” in your favorite search engine.</p>
<h2 id="duality-and-coloring" class="unnumbered">Duality and Coloring</h2>
<p>There is an interesting <span><em>duality</em></span> between planar graphs. For example, the Greeks knew that the octahedron and the cube are “dual” to each other, in the sense that the faces of one can be put in correspondence with the vertices of the other (think about it). The tetrahedron is self-dual. And the dodecahedron and the icosahedron (look for images in the web if you don’t know these pretty things) are also dual to one another.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Take a planar graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and assume it has no bridges and no degree-two nodes. Draw a new graph <span class="math inline">\(G^*\)</span>: Start by placing a node on each face of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Then draw an edge between two faces if they touch at an edge — draw the new edge so that it crosses that edge. The result is <span class="math inline">\(G^*\)</span>, also a planar graph. Notice now that, if you construct the dual of <span class="math inline">\(G^*\)</span>, it is the original graph: <span class="math inline">\((G^*)^*=G\)</span>.</p>
<p>Duality is a convenient consideration when thinking about planar graphs. Also, it tells us that “coloring a political map so that no two countries who share a border have the same color” is the same problem as “coloring the vertices of a planar graph (the dual of the political map) so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color”.</p>
<p>A famous theorem states that four colors are always enough! (Search for “four color theorem”.)</p>
<p>We shall prove something weaker:</p>
<p><span id="thm:five-color" class="pandoc-numbering-text thm"><strong>Theorem 4</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Every planar graph can be colored with five colors.</em></p>
<p>Before proceeding with the proof, we consider alternative legal colorings of a graph. We first take the subset of vertices of two colors, say <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and compute the connected components. We note that we can switch the two colors in a single connected component; consider any edge that is not in the connected component is clearly fine, any edge in the connected component has both endpoints switched which is also fine.</p>
<p><em>Proof</em>. Induction on <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. The base case is not worth talking about, so we go directly to the inductive step. Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a planar graph. I claim there is a node of degree five or less. In proof, consider the inequality <span class="math inline">\(e\leq 3v -6\)</span>. If all vertices had degree six or more, then <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> would be at least <span class="math inline">\(3v\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, consider a node <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> of degree five or less. If it has degree four or less, we are done: Remove <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, color the remaining graph with <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> colors (by induction), and then put <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> back in and color it by a color that is missing from its neighbors.</p>
<p>So, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> must have <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> vertices, and in the coloring of <span class="math inline">\(G-u\)</span> they all got different colors. Look at them clockwise around <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, and call them <span class="math inline">\(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4,u_5\)</span>, and their colors <span class="math inline">\(1,2,3,4,5\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now try to change the color of <span class="math inline">\(u_2\)</span> to color 4 by determining the connected component containing <span class="math inline">\(u_2\)</span> and consisting of vertices that are colored <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(u_4\)</span> is in the connected component, switching <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> is not helpful. But, we do know that there is a path between <span class="math inline">\(u_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_4\)</span> colored <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can try to change the color of <span class="math inline">\(u_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, and this will succeed unless there is a path between <span class="math inline">\(u_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(u_3\)</span> colored <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<p>If both of these attempts fail, then we get two paths: one from <span class="math inline">\(u_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(u_3\)</span> colored <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, and the other from <span class="math inline">\(u_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(u_4\)</span> colored <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. But planarity says that these two paths must intersect at some vertex. What is the color of this vertex? <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>

<h1 id="scn:types">Important Classes of Graphs</h1>
<p>As we have seen, graphs are an abstract and general construct allowing us to represent relationships between objects, such as houses and roads. In practice, certain classes of graphs prove especially useful. For example, imagine that our graph represents the interconnection between routers on the internet. To send a packet from one node to another, we need to find a path in this graph from our source and destination. Therefore, to be able to send a packet from any node to any other node, we only need the graph to be connected. A minimally connected graph is called a <span><em>tree</em></span>, and it is the most efficient graph (i.e., with minimum number of edges) we can use to connect any set of vertices.</p>
<p>But now suppose the connections between some routers are not too strong, so sometimes we can lose an edge between two vertices in the graph. If our graph is a tree, then removing an edge from it results in a disconnected graph, which means there are some vertices in the graph that we cannot reach. To avoid this bad case, we want some sort of redundancy or robustness in the graph connectivity. Clearly the most connected graph is the complete graph, in which all nodes are connected to all other nodes. However, as we shall see below, the complete graph uses exponentially many edges, which makes it impractical for large-scale problems.</p>
<p>There is also a nice family of graphs called the hypercube graphs, which combines the best of both worlds: they are robustly connected, but do not use too many edges. In this section, we study these three classes of graphs in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="scn:complete">Complete Graphs</h2>
<p>We start with the simplest class of graphs, the <em>complete</em> graphs. Why are such graphs called complete? Because they contain the <em>maximum</em> number of edges possible. In other words, in an undirected complete graph, every pair of (distinct) vertices <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> are connected by an edge <span class="math inline">\(\{u,v\}\)</span>. For example, below we have complete graphs on <span class="math inline">\(n=2,3,4\)</span> vertices, respectively.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n5-complete.png" style="width:50.0%" />

</div>
<p>Here, the notation <span class="math inline">\(K_n\)</span> denotes the <em>unique</em> complete graph on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices. Formally, we can write <span class="math inline">\(K_n=(V,E)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\({\lvert V \rvert}=n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E={\{\{v_i,v_j\}\mid v_i\neq v_j \text{ and }v_i,v_j\in V\}}\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sanity check!</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Can you draw <span class="math inline">\(K_5\)</span>, the complete graph on <span class="math inline">\(n = 5\)</span> vertices?</li>
<li>What is the degree of every vertex in <span class="math inline">\(K_n\)</span>?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> How many edges are there in <span class="math inline">\(K_n\)</span>? Answer: <span class="math inline">\(n \cdot (n - 1) / 2\)</span>. Verify that the <span class="math inline">\(K_5\)</span> you drew above has this many edges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, let us return to the theme of connectivity. A complete graph is special in that each vertex is neighbors with every other vertex. Thus, such a graph is very “strongly connected” in that a large number of edges must be removed before we disconnect the graph into two components. Why might this be a good property to have (say) in a communications network, where vertices correspond to mainframes, and edges correspond to communications channels?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sanity check!</em> What is the minimum number of edges which must be removed from <span class="math inline">\(K_n\)</span> to obtain an isolated vertex?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we can also discuss complete graphs for <em>directed</em> graphs, which are defined as you might expect: For any pair of vertices <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, both <span class="math inline">\((u,v),(v,u)\in E\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="scn:trees">Trees</h2>
<p>In this section, we return to trees. If complete graphs are “maximally connected,” then trees are the opposite: Removing just a single edge disconnects the graph! Formally, there are a number of equivalent definitions of when a graph <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> is a tree, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected and contains no cycles.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected and has <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> edges (where <span class="math inline">\(n = |V|\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected, and the removal of any single edge disconnects <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has no cycles, and the addition of any single edge creates a cycle.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here are three examples of trees:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n5-tree-1.png" style="width:50.0%" />

</div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sanity check!</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Convince yourself that the three graphs above satisfy all four equivalent definitions of a tree.</li>
<li>Give an example of a graph which is <em>not</em> a tree.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would we want to study such funny-looking graphs? One reason is that many graph-theoretical problems which are computationally intractable on arbitrary graphs, such as the Maximum Cut problem, are easy to solve on trees. Another reason is that they model many types of natural relationships between objects. To demonstrate, we now introduce the concept of a <em>rooted</em> tree, an example of which is given below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n5-tree.png" style="width:50.0%" />

</div>
<p>In a rooted tree, there is a designated node called the <em>root</em>, which we think of as sitting at the top of the tree. The bottom-most nodes are called <em>leaves</em>, and the intermediate nodes are called <em>internal nodes</em>. The <em>depth</em> <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of the tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. Moreover, the tree can be thought of as grouped into layers or <em>levels</em>, where the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th level for <span class="math inline">\(k\in{\{0,1,\ldots,d\}}\)</span> is the set of vertices which are connected to the root via a path consisting of precisely <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> edges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sanity check!</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the depth of the tree above? (Answer: <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>)</li>
<li>Which vertices are on level <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> of the tree above? How about on level <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Where do rooted trees come in handy? Consider, for example, the setting of bacterial cell division. In this case, the root might represent a single bacterium, and each subsequent layer corresponds to cell division in which the bacterium divides into two new bacteria. Rooted trees can also be used to allow fast searching of ordered sets of elements, such as in <em>binary search trees</em>, which you may have already encountered in your studies.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about trees is that induction works particularly well in proving properties of trees. Let us demonstrate with a case in point: We shall prove that the first two definitions of a tree given above are indeed equivalent.</p>
<p><span id="thm:equiv" class="pandoc-numbering-text thm"><strong>Theorem 5</strong></span></p>
<p><em>The statements “<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected and contains no cycles” and “<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected and has <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> edges” are equivalent.</em></p>
<p><em>Proof</em>. We proceed by showing the forward and converse directions.</p>
<p><em>Forward Direction.</em> We prove using strong induction on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that if <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected and contains no cycles, then <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected and has <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> edges. Assume <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> is connected and contains no cycles.</p>
<p><em>Base Case (<span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>):</em> In this case, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a single vertex and has no edges. Thus, the claim holds.</p>
<p><em>Inductive Hypothesis:</em> Assume the claim is true for <span class="math inline">\(1\leq n\leq k\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Inductive Proof:</em> We show the claim for <span class="math inline">\(n=k+1\)</span>. Remove an arbitrary vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\in V\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> along with its incident edges, and call the resulting graph <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>. Clearly, <em>removing</em> a vertex cannot create a cycle; thus, <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> contains no cycles. However, removing <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> may result in a <em>disconnected</em> graph <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>, in which case the induction hypothesis cannot be applied to <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> as a whole. Thus, we have two cases to examine — either <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> is connected, or <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> is disconnected. Here, we show the former case, as it is simpler and captures the essential proof ideas. The latter case is left as an exercise below.</p>
<p>So, assume <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> is connected. But now <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> is a connected graph with no cycles on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vertices, so we can apply the induction hypothesis to <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> to conclude that <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> is connected and has <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> edges. Let us now add <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> back to <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> to obtain <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. How many edges can be incident on <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>? Well, since <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> is connected, then if <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is incident on more than one edge, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> will contain a cycle. But by assumption <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has no cycles! Thus, <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> must be incident on one edge, implying <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\((k-1) + 1 = k\)</span> edges, as desired.</p>
<p><em>Converse Direction.</em> We prove using contradiction that if <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected and has <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> edges, then <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected and contains no cycles. Assume <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected, has <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> edges, and contains a cycle. Then, by definition of a cycle, removing any edge in the cycle does not disconnect the graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. In other words, we can remove an edge in the cycle to obtain a new connected graph <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> consisting of <span class="math inline">\(n-2\)</span> edges. However, we claim that <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> must be disconnected, which will yield our desired contradiction. This is because in order for a graph to be connected, it must have at least <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> edges. This is a fact that you have to prove in the exercise below. This completes the proof of the converse direction. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
<h2 id="scn:hyper">Hypercubes</h2>
<p>We have discussed how complete graphs are a class of graphs whose vertices are particularly “well-connected.” However, to achieve this strong connectivity, a large number of edges is required, which in many applications of graph theory is infeasible. Consider the example of the <em>Connection Machine</em>, which was a massively parallel computer by the company Thinking Machines in the 1980s. The idea of the Connection Machine was to have a million processors working in parallel, all connected via a communications network. If you were to connect each pair of such processors with a direct wire to allow them to communicate (i.e., if you used a complete graph to model your communications network), this would require <span class="math inline">\(10^{12}\)</span> wires! What the builders of the Connection Machine thus decided was to instead use a <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>-dimensional <em>hypercube</em> to model their network, which still allowed a strong level of connectivity, while limiting the number of neighbors of each processor in the network to <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>. This section is devoted to studying this particularly useful class of graphs, known as hypercubes.</p>
<p>The vertex set of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional hypercube <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(V=\{0,1\}^n\)</span>, where recall <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^n\)</span> denotes the set of all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-bit strings. In other words, each vertex is labeled by a unique <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-bit string, such as <span class="math inline">\(00110\cdots0100\)</span>. The edge set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is defined as follows: Two vertices <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are connected by edge <span class="math inline">\(\{x,y\}\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> differ in exactly one bit position. For example, <span class="math inline">\(x=0000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y=1000\)</span> are neighbors, but <span class="math inline">\(x=0000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y=0011\)</span> are not. More formally, <span class="math inline">\(x = x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y = y_1 y_2 \ldots y_n\)</span> are neighbors if and only if there is an <span class="math inline">\(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x_j = y_j\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(j \neq i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x_i \neq y_i\)</span>. To help you visualize the hypercube, we depict the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-, and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-dimensional hypercubes below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="n5-hypercube.png" style="width:50.0%" />

</div>
<p>There is an alternative and useful way to define the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional hypercube via recursion, which we now discuss. Define the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-subcube (respectively, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-subcube) as the <span class="math inline">\((n-1)\)</span>-dimensional hypercube with vertices labeled by <span class="math inline">\(0x\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x\in{\{0,1\}}^{n-1}\)</span> (respectively, <span class="math inline">\(1x\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x\in{\{0,1\}}^{n-1}\)</span>). Then, the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional hypercube is obtained by placing an edge between each pair of vertices <span class="math inline">\(0x\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-subcube and <span class="math inline">\(1x\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-subcube.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We began this section by singing praises for the hypercube in terms of its connectivity properties; we now investigate these claims formally. Let us begin by giving two proofs of a simple property of the hypercube. Each proof relies on one of our two equivalent (namely, direct and recursive) definitions of the hypercube.</p>
<p><span id="lemma:1" class="pandoc-numbering-text lemma"><strong>Lemma 1</strong></span></p>
<p><em>The total number of edges in an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional hypercube is <span class="math inline">\(n 2^{n-1}\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Proof</em>. The degree of each vertex is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bit positions can be flipped in any <span class="math inline">\(x\in{\{0,1\}}^n\)</span>. Since each edge is counted twice, once from each endpoint, this yields a total of <span class="math inline">\(n 2^n /2 = n2^{n-1}\)</span> edges. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p><em>Proof</em>. By the second definition of the hypercube, it follows that <span class="math inline">\(E(n) = 2E(n-1) + 2^{n-1}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(E(1) = 1\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(E(n)\)</span> denotes the number of edges in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional hypercube. A straightforward induction shows that <span class="math inline">\(E(n) = n 2^{n-1}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exercise.</em> Using induction to show that in Proof 2 above, <span class="math inline">\(E(n) = n2^{n-1}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us focus on the question of connectivity, and prove that the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional hypercube is well-connected in the following sense: To disconnect any subset <span class="math inline">\(S\subseteq V\)</span> of vertices from the rest of the graph, a large number of edges must be discarded. In particular, we shall see that the number of discarded edges must scale with <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S \rvert}\)</span>. In the theorem below, recall that <span class="math inline">\(V - S = \{v \in V \colon v \notin S\}\)</span> is the set of vertices that are not in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p><span id="thm:hypercube" class="pandoc-numbering-text thm"><strong>Theorem 6</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\subseteq V\)</span> be such that <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S \rvert}\leq {\lvert V-S \rvert}\)</span> (i.e., that <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S \rvert}\leq 2^{n-1}\)</span>), and let <span class="math inline">\(E_{S}\)</span> denote the set of edges connecting <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(V-S\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math display">\[E_S:={\{\{u,v\}\in E\mid u \in S \text{ and }v\in V-S\}}.\]</span> Then, it holds that <span class="math inline">\(|E_{S}| \geq |S|\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Proof</em>. We proceed by induction on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Base Case (<span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>):</em> The <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-dimensional hypercube graph has two vertices <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and one edge <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>. We also have the assumption <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S \rvert} \le 2^{1-1} = 1\)</span>, so there are two possibilities. First, if <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S \rvert} = 0\)</span>, then the claim trivially holds. Otherwise, if <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S \rvert} = 1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(S = \{0\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V - S = \{1\}\)</span>, or vice versa. In either case we have <span class="math inline">\(E_S = \{0,1\}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(|E_{S}| = 1 = {\lvert S \rvert}\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Inductive Hypothesis:</em> Assume the claim holds for <span class="math inline">\(1\leq n\leq k\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Inductive Step:</em> We prove the claim for <span class="math inline">\(n=k+1\)</span>. Recall that we have the assumption <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S \rvert}\leq 2^k\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(S_0\)</span> (respectively, <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span>) be the vertices from the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-subcube (respectively, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-subcube) in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. We have two cases to examine: Either <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> has a fairly equal intersection size with the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-subcubes, or it does not.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span><strong>Case 1: <span class="math inline">\(|S_0| \leq 2^{k-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|S_1| \leq 2^{k-1}\)</span></strong></span></p>
<p>In this case, we can apply the induction hypothesis separately to the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-subcubes. This says that restricted to the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-subcube itself, there are at least <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S_0 \rvert}\)</span> edges between <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S_0 \rvert}\)</span> and its complement (in the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-subcube), and similarly there are at least <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S_1 \rvert}\)</span> edges between <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S_1 \rvert}\)</span> and its complement (in the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-subcube). Thus, the total number of edges between <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V-S\)</span> is at least <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S_0 \rvert}+{\lvert S_1 \rvert}={\lvert S \rvert}\)</span>, as desired.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Case 2: <span class="math inline">\(|S_0| &gt; 2^{k-1}\)</span></strong></span></p>
<p>In this case, <span class="math inline">\(S_0\)</span> is unfortunately too large for the induction hypothesis to apply. However, note that since <span class="math inline">\(|S|\leq 2^{k}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S_1 \rvert} = {\lvert S \rvert} - {\lvert S_0 \rvert} \leq 2^{k-1}\)</span>, so we <em>can</em> apply the hypothesis to <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span>. As in Case 1, this allows us to conclude that there are at least <span class="math inline">\(|S_1|\)</span> edges in the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-subcube crossing between <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V - S\)</span>.</p>
<p>What about the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-subcube? Here, we cannot apply the induction hypothesis directly, but there is a way to apply it after a little massaging. Consider the set <span class="math inline">\(V_0 - S_0\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> is the set of vertices in the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-subcube. Note that <span class="math inline">\({\lvert V_0 \rvert} = 2^k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\lvert V_0 - S_0 \rvert} = {\lvert V_0 \rvert} - {\lvert S_0 \rvert} = 2^k - {\lvert S_0 \rvert} &lt; 2^k - 2^{k-1} =2^{k-1}\)</span>. Thus, we <em>can</em> apply the inductive hypothesis to the set <span class="math inline">\(V_0 - S_0\)</span>. This yields that the number of edges between <span class="math inline">\(S_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_0 - S_0\)</span> is at least <span class="math inline">\(2^{k} - |S_0|\)</span>. Adding our totals for the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-subcube and the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-subcube so far, we conclude there are at least <span class="math inline">\(2^{k} - |S_0| + |S_1|\)</span> crossing edges between <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V-S\)</span>. However, recall our goal was to show that the number of crossing edges is at least <span class="math inline">\({\lvert S \rvert}\)</span>; thus, we are still short of where we wish to be.</p>
<p>But there are a still edges we have not accounted for — namely, those in <span class="math inline">\(E_{S}\)</span> which cross between the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-subcubes. Since there is an edge between every vertex of the form <span class="math inline">\(0x\)</span> and the corresponding vertex <span class="math inline">\(1x\)</span>, we conclude there are at least <span class="math inline">\(|S_0| -|S_1|\)</span> edges in <span class="math inline">\(E_{S}\)</span> that cross between the two subcubes. Thus, the total number of edges crossing is at least <span class="math inline">\(2^{k} -|S_0| + |S_1| + |S_0| - |S_1| = 2^{k} \geq |S|\)</span>, as desired. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p></li>

    (a_1a_2...a_{n-1}, ~ a_2a_3...a_{n-1}0) \in E ~~~ \text{ and } ~~~
(a_1a_2...a_{n-1}, ~a_2a_3...a_{n-1}1) \in E.\end{aligned}\]</span> Therefore, each vertex also has two incoming edges: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    (0a_1a_2...a_{n-2},~a_1a_2...a_{n-1}) \in E ~~~ \text{ and } ~~~ 
(1a_1a_2...a_{n-2},~ a_1a_2...a_{n-1}) \in E.\end{aligned}\]</span> For example, for <span class="math inline">\(n = 4\)</span>, the vertex <span class="math inline">\(110\)</span> has two outgoing edges directed toward <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(101\)</span>, and two incoming edges from <span class="math inline">\(011\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(111\)</span>. Note that these are directed edges, and self-loops are permitted.</p>
<p>The de Bruijn sequence is generated by an Eulerian tour in the de Bruijn graph. <a href="#thm:euler">Euler's Theorem (1736)</a> can be modified to work for directed graphs — all we need to modify is the second condition, which should now say: “For every vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, the in-degree of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> equals the out-degree of <span class="math inline">\(v.\)</span>&quot; Clearly, the de Bruijn graph satisfies this condition, and therefore it has an Eulerian tour.</p>
<p>To actually generate the sequence, starting from any vertex, we walk along the tour and add the corresponding bit which was shifted in from the right as we traverse each edge. Here is the de Bruijn graph for <span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span>.</p>

<li><p>In this question, we complete the induction component of the proof of <a href="#thm:equiv">Theorem 5</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Suppose in the proof that <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> has two distinct connected components <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;_2\)</span>. Complete the inductive step to show that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected and has <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> edges. [<em>Hint</em>: Argue that you can apply the induction hypothesis to <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;_2\)</span> separately. Note that this requires strong induction!]</p></li>
<li><p>More generally, <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> may have <span class="math inline">\(t \ge 2\)</span> distinct connected components <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;_1\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;_t\)</span> — generalize your argument above to this setting in order to complete the proof of <a href="#thm:equiv">Theorem 5</a>.</p>

<p><em>Life lesson.</em> This question teaches you a general paradigm for solving problems, be it in computer science research or everyday life. Specifically, when faced with a difficult problem (such as the proof of <a href="#thm:equiv">Theorem 5</a>), first try to solve it in the simplest case possible (such as when <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> is connected). Then, gradually extend your solution to handle more difficult cases until you establish the general claim (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> connected components).</p>
